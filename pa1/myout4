        John Swain
  A CASE OF IDENTITY
  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
 A
 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
 A blow was struck
 A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin
 A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner
 A camp-bed
 A chair had been placed close to the central window
 A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
 A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows
 A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite
 A double carriage-sweep
 A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky
 A few country carts were stirring
 A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him
 A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty
 A fierce quarrel broke out
 A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes
 A fortnight went by
 A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
 A gentleman entered
 A girl of fourteen
 A groan of disappointment came up from below
 A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose
 A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
 A jagged stone was lying among the moss
 A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled
 A large face
 A lean
 A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
 A little over-precipitance may ruin all
 A lover evidently
 A mad
 A maid rushed across and threw open the window
 A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
 A man had waited outside the window
 A married woman grabs at her baby
 A mole could trace it
 A moment later we were out on the dark road
 A month ago
 A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle
 A precious stone
 A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose
 A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen
 A sandwich and a cup of coffee
 A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems
 A series of disgraceful brawls took place
 A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
 A shock of orange hair
 A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
 A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank
 A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner
 A stable-boy had run out to the horse
 A tall
 A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses
 A touch of red in nose and cheeks
 A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
 A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me
 A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me
 A ventilator is made
 About 
 About five ft
 About sunset
 About this girl
 About two in the morning
 Above all
 Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red
 Absolutely no clue in them to Mr
 Accustomed as I was to my friend
 Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day
 After all
 After an hour or so
 After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners
 Again I changed my dress
 Ah
 Air and scenery perfect
 Alice
 All day a stream of pennies
 All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows
 All emotions
 All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down
 All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh
 All over the countryside
 All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years
 All right
 All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
 All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective
 All these I may sketch out at some future date
 All this is amusing
 All was as we had seen it in the daytime
 All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me
 All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it
 All well
 All will come well
 Aloysius Doran
 Already I was unable to stand erect
 Also
 Altogether
 Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity
 Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber
 Among these he rummaged and read
 An 
 An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
 An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked
 An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders
 An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it
 An ordinary man could not do it
 And
 And about his quarrel with his father
 And good-night
 And he said that I had nothing fit to wear
 And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs
 And here he comes
 And here is the very note
 And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes
 And if it were guilty
 And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again
 And in practice again
 And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view
 And into her sitting-room
 And let me say to you
 And many men have been wrongfully hanged
 And no later than this morning
 And now
 And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
 And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him
 And now I will make the thing clear to you
 And now here is my pocket Petrarch
 And now let us consider another point
 And now let us hear a true account of the next act
 And now let us talk about George Meredith
 And now we must be silent and wait
 And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case
 And now--and now I am myself a branded thief
 And off he went
 And on the morning of the wedding
 And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this
 And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
 And she will do it
 And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me
 And so you won
 And the Rucastles go out to-night
 And the flap has been gummed
 And the man who wrote the note is a German
 And then
 And then I think that what he foresaw happened
 And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
 And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy
 And there is a little reward
 And this
 And this promises to be interesting
 And this stone
 And underneath
 And what conclusions did the coroner come to
 And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid
 And what do you intend to do
 And what do you think they found in the pockets
 And what does she propose to do with the photograph
 And when he speaks of Irene Adler
 And where was the place
 And which king
 And why could he not write
 And yet
 And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours
 And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease
 And yet even here we may discriminate
 And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation
 And yet if it were on the lawn
 And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me
 And yet she had some secret sorrow
 And yet there was but one woman to him
 And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos
 And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
 And yet you have seen
 And yet--
 And you have no doubt that it is your husband
 And you know where they are
 And your address
 And your address had been given me
 Angel
 Angel began to call
 Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--
 Another
 Anstruther would do your work for you
 Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss
 Anybody bringing--
 Anyhow
 Apply in person on Monday
 Archie
 Are you a married man
 Are you hungry
 Are you satisfied
 Are you sure that everything is fastened
 Armitage
 Arthur
 As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone
 As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight
 As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall
 As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper
 As I descended
 As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
 As I expected
 As I gave a last hurried glance around
 As I glanced at the box I noticed
 As I have reason to believe
 As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle
 As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him
 As I passed out through the wicket gate
 As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt
 As I passed the well-remembered door
 As I ran down the passage
 As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil
 As I strolled up and down
 As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others
 As I was already in debt to my tradesmen
 As a rule
 As evening drew in
 As far as I can make out
 As far as I have heard
 As far as the church door he brought her
 As he glanced down the advertisement column
 As he loved his cousin
 As he ran he jerked his hands up and down
 As he reached the corner of Goodge Street
 As he said
 As he spoke
 As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and
 As he stepped up to the cab
 As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household
 As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was
 As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years
 As it pulled up
 As it was
 As regards your hair
 As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning
 As the daughter could not have been less than twenty
 As to Holmes
 As to Mary Jane

 As to his dress

 As to who this prisoner is
 As to your practice
 As we approached
 As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
 As we entered he made neither sound nor motion
 As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
 As well as I could learn

 At that hour we shall be with you
 At the church door
 At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal
 At the foot of the stairs
 At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low
 At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of

 But our doubts will very soon be solved

 But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it
 But soon he found that that would not answer forever
 But that is a mere detail
 But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer
 But that was not quite good enough
 But the creature flapped and struggled
 But the deception could not be kept up forever
 But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you

 Having found the ash
 Having laid out all these luxuries
 Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points
 Having no mother
 Having once made up my mind
 Having taken the printed description
 He
 He advanced slowly into the room
 He and a girl of fourteen
 He and the two mates
 He answered that the name was new to him
 He appeared to be in a great hurry
 He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there
 He appeared to be wrenching at it
 He asked for Alice
 He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park
 He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way
 He bowed
 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
 He brought up a card
 He burst into convulsive sobbing
 He calls attention
 He came back alone
 He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
 He caught up a pen
 He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea
 He chuckled to himself as he spoke
 He con
 He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands
 He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post
 He curled himself up in his chair
 He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
 He dashed her to one side
 He denied strenuously having
 He did tell me the address
 He does not say so
 He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily
 He drank more than ever
 He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab
 He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view
 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
 He drew up the windows on either side
 He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before
 He followed me to my room
 He found
 He gathered up the garments
 He gives me hopes
 He had
 He had a garden and two or three fields round his house
 He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel
 He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross
 He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes
 He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened
 He had even smoked there
 He had evidently been carried down by two persons
 He had for years been known as a professional beggar
 He had foresight
 He had made a very considerable fortune in the States
 He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies
 He had no occupation
 He had nothing a few years ago
 He had remained with Horner some little time
 He had returned with the prize
 He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem
 He had set the engine at work
 He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son
 He had trained it
 He had turned his back so that none could see him but I
 He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb
 He has a passion also for Indian animals
 He has been a disappointment to me
 He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases
 He has died within ten seconds of being bitten
 He has little time
 He has nerve and he has knowledge
 He has not been home for two days
 He has one positive virtue
 He has seen too much
 He has taken to his bed
 He hastened upstairs
 He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper
 He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone
 He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
 He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room
 He is a Mr
 He is a professional beggar
 He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone
 He is dark
 He is not a bad fellow
 He is not a very quick-witted youth
 He is older than Arthur
 He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler
 He is round in the stable lane now
 He is small for his age
 He knew he was safe with her
 He laughed
 He laughed until he choked
 He laughed very heartily
 He lay back without wincing
 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again
 He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf
 He led us down a passage
 He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look
 He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp
 He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes
 He looked at me with a last long
 He looked from one to the other of us
 He looked her over in his searching fashion
 He made a slight motion to me to approach him
 He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
 He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones
 He moved out yesterday
 He mumbled a few words
 He mumbled several words
 He never did wish us to go anywhere
 He never spoke of the softer passions
 He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
 He opened his bag as he spoke
 He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke
 He opened the case
 He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman
 He opened the yellow envelope
 He overdid it
 He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece
 He placed his finger in the centre of the circle
 He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room
 He put his hand over part of the map
 He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance
 He put less weight upon it
 He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him
 He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through
 He raised his hand
 He ran round
 He ran up and down
 He ran when he saw his father on the ground
 He received us in his quietly genial fashion
 He relapsed into a moody silence
 He rose as he spoke
 He rummaged amid his newspapers
 He rummaged in his coat pocket
 He rushed down
 He rushed fiercely forward
 He rushes to some secret hoard
 He said a few words to each candidate as he came up
 He said that he had never heard of any such body
 He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady
 He said the folk were not fit for us to know
 He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key
 He sat at my side in silence all the time
 He saw her stealthily open the window
 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion
 He shall find me ready when he comes back
 He shook hands with us and took his leave
 He shot a questioning glance at each of us
 He slapped it down upon the table in front of him
 He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand
 He slipped his key into the lock
 He spoke calmly
 He spoke in a jesting tone
 He spoke in a slow staccato fashion
 He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation
 He sprang round
 He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
 He started me off upon the letter A
 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled
 He stepped swiftly forward
 He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit
 He suddenly sprang up
 He swung himself up onto the roof
 He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age
 He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred
 He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward
 He threw over a sheet of thick
 He throws it out
 He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad
 He took a large villa
 He took a step backward
 He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
 He took off his coat and waistcoat
 He took the more chivalrous view
 He took two swift steps to the whip
 He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
 He took up the paper in a listless way
 He tossed a crumpled letter across to me
 He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping
 He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
 He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
 He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road
 He walked up to the sideboard
 He wanted her to sign a paper
 He was
 He was a devil incarnate
 He was a late riser
 He was a lawyer
 He was a middle-sized man
 He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire
 He was a remarkably handsome man
 He was a singular man
 He was a small
 He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready
 He was always well dressed
 He was an old friend of McCarthy
 He was at work again
 He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
 He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight
 He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end
 He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style
 He was himself red-headed
 He was in a pitiable state of reaction
 He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear
 He was kind to her also in his bluff
 He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown
 He was much excited
 He was not a popular man
 He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone
 He was pacing the room swiftly
 He was plainly but neatly dressed
 He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books
 He was removed
 He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said
 He was still
 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
 He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him
 He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane
 He was too good and kind to leave me so
 He was trying to utter the name of his murderer
 He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets
 He was very willing to have a holiday
 He was wild
 He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
 He was young
 He waved his hand
 He waved his hands
 He waved his hands frantically to her
 He will be here in an hour
 He will be silent
 He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him
 He wished us to leave him alone
 He wore rather baggy grey shepherd
 He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat
 He would not go to the police
 He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best
 He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight
 He would see it through the ventilator
 He would seize the coat
 He would show me how to turn the stone into money
 He wouldn

 His eyes twinkled
 His face flushed and darkened

 His face was bent downward
 His features were gravely set
 His footmarks had pressed right through the snow
 His form had filled out
 His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man

 His rooms were brilliantly lit

 Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard
 Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent
 Holmes drove in silence
 Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it
 Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down
 Holmes interposed
 Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house
 Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him
 Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced
 Holmes refused to examine the third chamber
 Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
 Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
 Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced
 Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client
 Holmes sprang from the bed
 Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood
 Holmes stooped to the water-jug
 Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and
 Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it
 Holmes the relentless
 Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen
 Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light
 Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
 Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man
 Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle
 Holmes walked over to his desk
 Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest
 Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
 Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face
 Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock
 Holmes whistled
 Holmes--a grievous disappointment
 Horner
 Hosmer Angel
 Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back
 Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more
 Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct
 Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory
 Hosmer came for us in a hansom
 Hosmer--Mr
 How came the stone into the goose
 How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
 How could my hair have been locked in the drawer
 How could she
 How could you know anything of the matter
 How cruelly I have misjudged him
 How dare you touch that coronet
 How did your mother take the matter
 How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately
 How do you go back
 How he did it I could not imagine
 How long they seemed
 How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight
 How very impertinent
 How was it
 How was it done
 How you startled me
 However
 However innocent he might be
 However that may be
 Hudson came
 Hudson has been knocked up
 Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire
 Hudson to examine its crop
 Hum
 I
 I advertised
 I already feel it closing in upon me
 I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it
 I am Alexander Holder
 I am a dangerous man to fall foul of
 I am a light sleeper
 I am a very stay-at-home man
 I am a widower and have an only son
 I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory
 I am afraid
 I am afraid that I am a little late
 I am afraid that I must press it
 I am all impatience to be gone
 I am all off colour
 I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise
 I am at my wit
 I am bound to say
 I am but thirty now
 I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted
 I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes
 I am descending
 I am ever your loving
 I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave
 I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results
 I am glad to see that Mrs
 I am going out now
 I am going through the City first
 I am illegally detained
 I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry
 I am lost without my Boswell
 I am much indebted to you
 I am not a very heavy sleeper
 I am not hysterical
 I am not joking
 I am not over-tender of heart
 I am prepared to leave it with you as my security
 I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion
 I am saved
 I am so frightened
 I am so frightened about him
 I am somewhat of a fowl fancier
 I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter
 I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing
 I am sorry to have interrupted you
 I am sorry to hear you say that
 I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry
 I am sure
 I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it
 I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him
 I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning
 I am the last court of appeal
 I am to do it in the name of the firm
 I am very angry indeed
 I answer
 I answered
 I answered firmly
 I answered frankly
 I answered sharply
 I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter
 I ask you not merely because my friend Dr
 I ask you now
 I asked
 I asked as I entered
 I asked when I had finished
 I asked with interest
 I asks
 I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance
 I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months
 I at his heels
 I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 
 I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem
 I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things
 I began to ask about father
 I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing
 I began to laugh at this
 I began to think
 I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more
 I begged a fortnight
 I believe
 I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 
 I believe that he foresaw some danger
 I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
 I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
 I believe that that is the village inn over there
 I blew its brains out
 I blinked up at him in some surprise
 I bought this estate
 I braved him to do his worst
 I call him a gentleman by courtesy
 I call him father
 I call him mine
 I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham
 I called in the inspector and gave him into custody
 I came in by train this morning
 I came right away to you
 I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot
 I came to seek a theory
 I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill
 I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed
 I can deduce nothing else
 I can do nothing for myself
 I can go elsewhere
 I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise
 I can make neither head nor tail of the business
 I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves
 I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when
 I can only say
 I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father
 I can see him now
 I can stand this strain no longer
 I cannot
 I cannot allow that there is any humiliation
 I cannot blame you
 I cannot find words to thank you
 I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine
 I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran
 I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine
 I cannot tell
 I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room
 I caught a glimpse of rushing figures
 I caught it
 I clambered out upon the sill
 I confess
 I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
 I confess that I felt easier in my mind when
 I confess that I miss my rubber
 I confess that I was disappointed
 I confess that the guilt of the banker
 I congratulate you
 I congratulate you warmly
 I could
 I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in
 I could even tell that they had been disturbed
 I could make nothing at all of what it meant
 I could manage it better if I were alone
 I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
 I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me
 I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
 I could not hear a sound
 I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result
 I could not live there longer without some advice
 I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
 I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence
 I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him
 I could see a change in my uncle
 I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear
 I could see that she was pretty
 I could tell you tales of cobbler
 I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building
 I cried
 I cried half-mad with grief and rage
 I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street
 I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation
 I daresay
 I dashed some brandy into the water
 I deduce it
 I deduced a ventilator
 I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross
 I determined
 I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street
 I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police
 I did
 I did bang out of the house
 I did it
 I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
 I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them
 I did not know what to do
 I did not mind you so much
 I did not scorn her advice
 I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
 I did not wonder at Lestrade
 I did what I could to relieve his pain
 I did what she said
 I didn
 I dine at seven
 I distinctly saw his bare throat
 I do
 I do not
 I do not know
 I do not know at what hour he came in
 I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers
 I do not know what I could do without her
 I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing
 I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
 I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 
 I do not see that it helps us much
 I do not think so
 I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man
 I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman
 I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night
 I don
 I doubt if ever he set foot in the town
 I dressed hurriedly
 I dropped my gun and held him in my arms
 I ejaculated
 I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
 I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers
 I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it
 I examined
 I exclaimed
 I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
 I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head
 I fail to see how you work it out
 I fainted dead away
 I fainted when it was done
 I fancy
 I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs
 I fancy we may have some company dropping in
 I fear
 I fear that I bore you with these details
 I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
 I fear that you have felt the draught
 I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial
 I fear that you will find it very slow
 I feared to refer them to you
 I feel a new man
 I feel better now
 I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
 I felt
 I felt that I was probably on the right track
 I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel
 I find many tragic
 I followed Holmes up the small
 I followed them up and found they led to the hall window
 I followed you to your door
 I forbid you
 I foresee
 I forgot that
 I found
 I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
 I found Sherlock Holmes alone
 I found her to be a silent
 I found it hard to think evil of such a dear
 I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
 I found my father expiring upon the ground
 I found my plans very seriously menaced
 I found myself inside the bedroom
 I found that I had my man
 I found that the pavement had been cleared
 I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one
 I found the ash of a cigar
 I found the den of which I was in search
 I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room
 I gasped
 I gave a cry of surprise
 I gave the maid a card
 I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes
 I glanced at him again
 I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew
 I glanced down
 I glanced down at my hand
 I got a few patients from among the officials
 I got among bad companions
 I got his leave to come into town this morning
 I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden
 I guess you have every cause to be
 I had
 I had a dozen
 I had a feeling something was there
 I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
 I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself
 I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter
 I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad
 I had been told that
 I had been warned against you months ago
 I had begun to take comfort too soon
 I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies
 I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
 I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep
 I had filled the first two with my linen
 I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room
 I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse
 I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women
 I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo
 I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder
 I had let myself go
 I had narrowed the field down considerably
 I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning
 I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade
 I had no idea
 I had no idea that he was in front of me
 I had no time to think of it
 I had not a suspicion
 I had not an idea who you were when you came in
 I had not gone more than 
 I had remained indoors all day
 I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
 I had said to her last night
 I had seen what he had seen
 I had something else to think of
 I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
 I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
 I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker
 I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he
 I hadn
 I hardened my heart
 I hardly looked at his face
 I hardly noticed his appearance
 I hate to meet her
 I have
 I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking
 I have a confused memory
 I have a fairly long list at present
 I have a professional commission for you
 I have already arranged what is to occur
 I have already learned all that is in the public prints
 I have already offered a reward of 
 I have been at work upon it all day
 I have been cut to the quick
 I have been dragging the Serpentine
 I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last
 I have been trained as an actress myself
 I have been twenty-seven years in the force
 I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it
 I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful
 I have caught you
 I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you
 I have determined
 I have done nothing actionable from the first
 I have drawn my circle
 I have driven down to tell you so
 I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it
 I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it
 I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation
 I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children
 I have given you all the facts
 I have got it now
 I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of
 I have had nothing since breakfast
 I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red
 I have heard of that fellow
 I have heard of you
 I have heard of you before
 I have heard of you from Mrs
 I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man
 I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London
 I have it here and I will read it to you
 I have it here in my museum
 I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars
 I have known something of him before
 I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it
 I have little doubt
 I have lost four pound a week
 I have lost my honour
 I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee
 I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject
 I have my dooties
 I have my hand upon him
 I have myself some small business matters to attend to
 I have never denied him a wish
 I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries
 I have no data
 I have no doubt
 I have no doubt at all that he had left it there
 I have no doubt that
 I have no doubt that I am myself to blame
 I have no doubt that it is the daughter
 I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone
 I have no doubt that she loved you
 I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
 I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client
 I have no idea what she meant
 I have no one to turn to--none
 I have no time
 I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you
 I have not
 I have not come to stay
 I have not seen a paper for some days
 I have not treated her ungenerously
 I have one waiting
 I have only just heard the facts
 I have only just left him
 I have seen young McCarthy
 I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
 I have some account of the matter here
 I have taken you fully into my confidence now
 I have the honour to wish you a very good morning
 I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind
 I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
 I have traced her
 I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance
 I heard a gentle sound of movement
 I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal
 I heard her voice downstairs
 I heard his wife tell Mrs
 I heard no more
 I heard that
 I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also
 I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once
 I hope that I have made myself clear
 I hope that I make it all plain
 I hope that I may be back in a few hours
 I hope that you have done what I asked you
 I hope that you will postpone it
 I hope to goodness the house won
 I hurled it
 I hurried to him
 I imagine in which you were interested--white
 I imagine that you saw all that I did
 I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake
 I implored the colonel to let me out
 I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark
 I invited them to meet him here
 I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards
 I keep it only to safeguard myself
 I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked
 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again
 I knelt beside him for some minutes
 I knew
 I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage
 I knew little of my former friend and companion
 I knew my man
 I knew that he would be true to me
 I knew that it was my sister
 I knew that it was not you who had brought it down
 I knew that my assistant was a good man
 I knew that my own fate was sealed
 I knew that none had fallen since the evening before
 I knew that you went out little
 I knew the firm for which this man worked
 I know
 I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St
 I know all about McCarthy
 I know everything of it
 I know him from the photograph
 I know it
 I know no one in these parts
 I know nothing further of the matter
 I know some of them
 I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went
 I know that James didn
 I know that Miss Stoner has been here
 I know that all is well with him
 I know that everything was turning round
 I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly
 I know that he is right
 I know that her word is inviolate
 I know that she will do it
 I know that there are seventeen steps
 I know the military neatness which characterises you
 I know you well
 I laid the two tresses together
 I lay listening with all my ears
 I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H
 I leave a photograph which he might care to possess
 I leave it with you
 I leave my estate
 I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm
 I left the bird
 I left the breakfast-table
 I left the house a little after eight o
 I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses
 I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it
 I look at them
 I looked at it before
 I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church
 I love and am loved by a better man than he
 I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs
 I made him keep the appointment
 I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress
 I marked the spot upon my own head
 I married
 I may add
 I may add that his whole debts at the present moment
 I may be on the trail in this matter
 I may have to go down to Horsham
 I may possibly have been deceived
 I may say that I have met
 I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair
 I may tell you that
 I may want your help
 I met Mr
 I met her several times
 I met him that night
 I met him twice for walks
 I might at any moment be seized and searched
 I motioned for air
 I must be dull
 I must compliment you
 I must go
 I must go back to the commencement of the affair
 I must go now
 I must not sit gossiping here
 I must pack at once
 I must raise the money in some way
 I must still refuse
 I must wire to the King without delay
 I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise
 I never
 I never dared to leave the room for an instant
 I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter
 I never heard of her using it
 I never noticed that before
 I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
 I never went wrong before
 I never will again
 I observe
 I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme
 I observed
 I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end
 I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives
 I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment
 I only doubt--
 I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
 I only wonder I didn
 I ordered her to say nothing
 I ordered him to pay over fifty 
 I ought to know its size and shape
 I paced up and down the 
 I paid the man and hurried into the church
 I painted my face
 I panted
 I passed along the tradesmen
 I passed down the steps
 I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
 I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road
 I presume
 I presume that I may take it as correct--this article
 I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate
 I promise
 I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed
 I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me
 I put my handkerchief up to my eyes
 I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver
 I put on my hat and cloak
 I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise
 I ran to her and threw my arms round her
 I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper
 I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own
 I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room
 I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally
 I read
 I read for about ten minutes
 I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column
 I read suspicion there and annoyance
 I really could not
 I recall the case
 I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but
 I remarked
 I remarked as he entered
 I remarked with some coldness
 I remember
 I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
 I remember that it was full of papers
 I returned the strange hair to the drawer
 I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity
 I roared
 I rose
 I rushed across the bedroom
 I rushed down the passage
 I rushed forward
 I rushed out
 I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle
 I rushed upstairs
 I said
 I said no more but
 I sat down beside the fire
 I sat up in my chair
 I saw Whitney
 I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards
 I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard
 I saw his tall
 I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage
 I saw no one near my father when I returned
 I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him
 I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck
 I saw the man
 I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp
 I saw where Boots had faced round
 I say
 I say it is south
 I screamed
 I see
 I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
 I see nothing in that
 I see the direction in which all this points
 I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless
 I sent John
 I sent him a couple of dozen
 I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once
 I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully
 I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true
 I shall be all anxiety
 I shall be busy this afternoon
 I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you
 I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
 I shall be indeed happy
 I shall be my own police
 I shall be true to Hosmer
 I shall be with you in five minutes
 I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you
 I shall call with the King to-morrow
 I shall certainly do as you advise
 I shall commence with the City
 I shall communicate with you
 I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
 I shall drop you a line before I leave
 I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife
 I shall go mad if it continues
 I shall have recourse to other methods
 I shall have the others
 I shall have to tell my tale to the police
 I shall keep the stone
 I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
 I shall look into the matter between this and then
 I shall not feel easy until I have told my story
 I shall not say another word about this business
 I shall now continue my investigations outside
 I shall set my hand upon this gang
 I shall stand behind this crate
 I shall take no notice of such nonsense
 I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it
 I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible
 I shall take your advice in every particular
 I shall want your co-operation
 I shall want your help to-night
 I shall write to Mr
 I shall write two letters
 I shan
 I should be compelled to stop the night
 I should be glad to know what they would be
 I should be surprised if they believed my statement
 I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket
 I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard
 I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me
 I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious
 I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
 I should have thought a little more
 I should judge
 I should like
 I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
 I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it
 I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
 I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha
 I should much prefer to communicate with you alone
 I should never have had a fear for her
 I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
 I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair
 I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it
 I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement
 I should not stay here
 I should not wish a smarter assistant
 I should prefer not to answer
 I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me
 I should say
 I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend
 I should think
 I shouted
 I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear
 I simply wish to hear your real
 I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
 I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me
 I slipped out
 I slipped out of bed
 I snatched it up and examined it
 I soon found Briony Lodge
 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them
 I sprang from my bed
 I sprang up and lit the lamp
 I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair
 I stared at it horror-stricken
 I started off for Pope
 I started when I saw the name
 I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was
 I stood firm
 I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house
 I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and v
 I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death
 I suddenly heard the sound of ste
 I suppose
 I suppose that I am commuting a felony
 I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room
 I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers
 I suppose that you have been watching the habits
 I suppose there would be no chance of a train back
 I suppose you know what you have got
 I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick
 I swear it
 I take it
 I tell you
 I tell you that
 I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man
 I then glanced at her face
 I then hurried forward
 I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London
 I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it
 I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool
 I think
 I think it was before your time
 I think myself that it is a page from some private diary
 I think that
 I think that I
 I think that I could be of assistance to you
 I think that I have nearly all my data
 I think that I have seen enough now
 I think that I have touched bottom at last
 I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
 I think that I must turn to you Watson
 I think that I recognise the symptoms
 I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran
 I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she
 I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
 I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered
 I think that the change would do you good
 I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
 I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
 I think that there was probably some more tangible cause
 I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
 I think that was the chain of events
 I think that we have got them right enough
 I think that we may gain that by means of the law
 I think that we may judge Lord St
 I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night
 I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him
 I think we had better do as you suggest
 I think you know Mr
 I thought
 I thought I heard a ring
 I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart
 I thought it as well to have Jones with us also
 I thought it was Wednesday
 I thought it was his ghost at first
 I thought of my fifty-guinea fee
 I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel
 I thought of the assistant
 I thought of the salt that I have been working upon
 I thought over the matter all day
 I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it
 I thought that he was delirious
 I thought that it must be when I saw the door open
 I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do
 I thought there might be some weapon or other trace
 I threw all fears to the winds
 I threw myself
 I threw open the window
 I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach
 I told Arthur and Mary my experience
 I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--
 I told it to him
 I told my pal what I had done
 I took a few of my friends into the secret
 I took a good look at the man and endeavoured
 I took advantage now of my attainments
 I took my station in the business part of the city
 I took the letters in in the morning
 I took two steps forward and looked back
 I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap
 I tossed them all aside and lay listless
 I traced her
 I travelled in my youth
 I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were
 I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible
 I tried to puzzle it out
 I trust
 I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past
 I turned the key gently in the lock
 I understand
 I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me
 I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here
 I understand that the cry of 
 I understand that this gentleman
 I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you
 I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort
 I used to be able to keep two assistants
 I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting
 I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St
 I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side
 I waited in my little den
 I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view
 I walked round the corner
 I want the doctor
 I want to see whether the objections are fatal
 I was Isa Whitney
 I was a young chap then
 I was about to say
 I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me
 I was all on fire to go over them
 I was already a dying and a desperate man
 I was already deeply interested in his inquiry
 I was always to remember that I was pledged to him
 I was arrested as his murderer
 I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind
 I was at my wit
 I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son
 I was awakened by some sound in the house
 I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room
 I was conscious of a dull pain
 I was determined that the law should have its way in everything
 I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible
 I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it
 I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller
 I was frightened of the house
 I was glad
 I was glad that he should go
 I was in error
 I was in time for the last train to Eyford
 I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her
 I was just balancing whether I should run for it
 I was keenly on my guard against him
 I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet
 I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat
 I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted
 I was preoccupied with business matters
 I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again
 I was shocked by the change which had come over him
 I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open
 I was so pleased at my own good fortune
 I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr
 I was standing
 I was ten miles or so from Eyford
 I was the only passenger who got out there
 I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred
 I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that
 I was to be true
 I was too shaken to go to bed again
 I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murd
 I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now
 I was very weak
 I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door
 I was young
 I wasn
 I went about
 I went and saw him
 I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning
 I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George
 I went into the station and asked about the morning train
 I went out
 I went to my work as usual at ten o
 I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be
 I went to the landlord
 I whispered
 I will call at four o
 I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard
 I will explain the state of things to you
 I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours
 I will keep your confession
 I will leave the country
 I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world
 I will read it to you
 I will sit on the side of the bed
 I will tell you
 I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago
 I wish I knew how you reach your results
 I wish she had been of my own station
 I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then
 I wish you would do as much for me
 I won
 I wonder I didn
 I wonder at that
 I wonder that you did not hear it also
 I wonder who the deuce that could have been
 I would call your attention very particularly to two points
 I would do it again
 I would have given it up in despair
 I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear
 I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine
 I would not have missed it for worlds
 I would not have them ashamed of their father
 I would not miss it for anything
 I would send you a wire
 I would take my goose now
 I wouldn
 I yelled
 If
 If 
 If Horner were in danger it would be another thing
 If I can be of any assistance
 If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter
 If I could only bring you down all would be well
 If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine
 If I remember rightly
 If he braved the matter out
 If he is violent
 If his purpose were innocent
 If it had been written straight off
 If my hair would only change colour
 If not
 If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away
 If she does not love your Majesty
 If she had
 If she were ill-used
 If so
 If the former
 If the lady loves her husband
 If the latter
 If the young lady has a brother or a friend
 If there
 If they fire
 If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
 If this fail
 If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago
 If this man ordered one
 If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes
 If we could fly out of that window hand in hand
 If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day
 If you but make such reparation as is in your power
 If you can enjoy it in peace
 If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I
 If you could send her into the cellar on some errand
 If you don
 If you find you cannot
 If you have not
 If you leave
 If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--
 If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves
 If you two will take the first hansom
 If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you
 If you will have the goodness to touch the bell
 If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets
 If you will wait outside
 If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you
 Imagine
 Impossible
 In Victoria
 In a few minutes I had written my note
 In a fit of anger
 In a hundred other ways he has helped him
 In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser
 In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn
 In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
 In a word
 In an instant his strange headgear began to move
 In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion
 In dress now
 In each case
 In fact
 In front of him he saw
 In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match
 In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
 In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
 In life or in death
 In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one
 In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards
 In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes
 In spite of its youth
 In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up
 In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings
 In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt
 In that
 In that case
 In that way I didn
 In the card-case is a note
 In the case of Pondicherry
 In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me
 In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there
 In the first place
 In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
 In the last century
 In the latter
 In the meantime Mr
 In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door
 In the pocket is a card-case
 In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are
 In the road stood our horse and trap
 In the scuffle
 In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue
 In the surgeon
 In these cases
 In this I was asked to sit
 In this case
 In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
 In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr
 In this way you see K
 In two hours we must be on the scene of action
 Indeed
 Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories
 Inspector Barton
 Inspector Bradstreet
 Inspector Bradstreet would
 Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours
 Irene Adler
 Irish-setter
 Is it not a pity that she was not on my level
 Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic
 Is it possible that even now
 Is that your hat
 Is the security sufficient
 Isa Whitney
 It
 It appeared to you to be a simple case
 It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro
 It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman
 It arrived upon Christmas morning
 It becomes a personal matter with me now
 It brings me twopence a sheet
 It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose
 It conveyed no meaning to me
 It corresponds with the injuries
 It cost me something in foolscap
 It could not be delirium
 It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it
 It could only be a small one
 It cuts into glass as though it were putty
 It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this
 It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it
 It grew broader
 It grew worse as Alice grew up
 It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
 It had ceased ere I was wide awake
 It had escaped my memory
 It had only lain there a few days
 It hadn
 It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money
 It has been considered artistic
 It is
 It is Wednesday
 It is a bijou villa
 It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data
 It is a cold night
 It is a customary contraction like our 
 It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
 It is a hat of the very best quality
 It is a hereditary matter
 It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London
 It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire
 It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
 It is a perfectly overpowering impulse
 It is a pity
 It is a pure matter of form
 It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention
 It is a very sweet little problem
 It is absolutely unique
 It is all dark to me
 It is all right
 It is an old trick
 It is cabinet size
 It is certain
 It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter
 It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station
 It is equally certain
 It is evident
 It is evidently trying to your nerves
 It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor
 It is founded upon the observation of trifles
 It is headed
 It is her carriage
 It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open
 It is in New Zealand stock
 It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia
 It is in the personal column of the Morning Post
 It is introspective
 It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives
 It is just possible
 It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow
 It is most important
 It is most refreshingly unusual
 It is my belief
 It is my business to know what other people don
 It is my strong impression that I heard it
 It is nearly five now
 It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
 It is not a common experience among employers in this age
 It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl
 It is not so impossible
 It is not too much to say that once or twice
 It is of importance
 It is one of these cases--but
 It is only fair to them to say that
 It is past ten
 It is peculiarly strong and stiff
 It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light
 It is perhaps the best possible solution
 It is pleasant to me to observe
 It is possible
 It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before
 It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt
 It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day
 It is probable
 It is probable that he will be away all day
 It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man
 It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland
 It is quite too transparent
 It is really impossible for me to tell you
 It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison
 It is terror
 It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs
 It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening
 It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber
 It is the five miles of country which makes the danger
 It is the more strange
 It is the most lovely country
 It is the precious stone
 It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside
 It is there that I shall seek it
 It is this infernal St
 It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
 It is three now
 It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you
 It is to that remark that she refers in this note
 It is true that 
 It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess
 It is true that you have missed everything of importance
 It is unthinkable
 It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity
 It is very unlike his usual writing
 It is well thought of
 It is your commonplace
 It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest
 It lay between that and her bedroom
 It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure
 It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission
 It may
 It may be so in this case
 It may be some time before I get back
 It may have been taken from him
 It may stop his gossip
 It may well have been cause and effect
 It migh
 It might be a lover
 It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands
 It must
 It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it
 It must be bought
 It must be confessed
 It must be done at once
 It must be in her own house
 It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation
 It must be where she can lay her hands upon it
 It must have been a very long time
 It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems
 It must have been this morning
 It must have bled considerably
 It only remains
 It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name
 It ran
 It ran in this way
 It read in this fashion
 It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart
 It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will
 It seemed funny that I should ask his leave
 It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
 It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning
 It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties
 It seemed to me to be something grey in colour
 It seems
 It seems absurdly simple
 It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone
 It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement
 It seems that there had been some informality about their license
 It seems to me
 It seldom was
 It struck cold to our hearts
 It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
 It swelled up louder and louder
 It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment
 It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side
 It was
 It was I
 It was Neville St
 It was a beautiful moonlight night
 It was a bright
 It was a chestnut
 It was a considerable sum
 It was a curious way of managing it
 It was a delicate part which I had to play then
 It was a delicate point
 It was a giant dog
 It was a homely little room
 It was a labyrinth of an old house
 It was a little past six when I arrived
 It was a long fight between my pride and the money
 It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller
 It was a perfect day
 It was a poky
 It was a pretty expensive joke for them
 It was a quiet
 It was a small
 It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge
 It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape
 It was a widespread
 It was a wild night
 It was a wonderfully silent house
 It was all done in an instant
 It was already dusk
 It was an Indian cigar
 It was an ideal spring day
 It was as well for his resolution
 It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back
 It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
 It was damp
 It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way
 It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted
 It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son
 It was empty
 It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle
 It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way
 It was from her that I had your address
 It was headed
 It was indeed a gigantic one
 It was instantly opened by a bright-looking
 It was mere chance that he was within earshot
 It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place
 It was my coil of hair
 It was nearly ten o
 It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent
 It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide
 It was no wonder that no one was stirring
 It was not a common thing for him to receive letters
 It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature
 It was not in front
 It was not mere curiosity
 It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume
 It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler
 It was not until close upon six o
 It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more
 It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller
 It was of excellent material
 It was of the same peculiar tint
 It was one bird
 It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west
 It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so
 It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman
 It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles
 It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
 It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer
 It was quite against my wishes that she came
 It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father
 It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
 It was something terrible and deadly
 It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting
 It was the band
 It was the bisulphate of baryta
 It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder
 It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life
 It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected
 It was the same next week
 It was the toy which he had promised to bring home
 It was to be at St
 It was twenty-five minutes past four
 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
 It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol
 It was worth an effort to preserve it
 It will end in my being conveyed into the house
 It would be a pity to miss it
 It would be a sharp-eyed coroner
 It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes
 It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested
 It would break their hearts
 It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments
 It would only have made him mad to know
 Its finder has carried it off
 Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts
 Its owner is unknown
 Its power was used for political purposes
 Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it

 My attention was speedily drawn
 My clothes were all sodden with dew
 My companion noiselessly closed the shutters
 My companion sat in the front of the trap
 My dear wife knew that I had business in the City
 My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month
 My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side
 My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it
 My father had a small factory at Coventry
 My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood
 My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield
 My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival
 My first glance is always at a woman
 My friend rose now and paced up and down the room
 My friend tore it open
 My groom and my page sleep out of the house

 My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit

 My stepdaughter has been here
 My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match
 My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage
 My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature
 My wants were few and simple
 My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty
 My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
 My wife is very anxious that you should come
 My wife was on a visit to her mother
 Naturally
 Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle
 Nev
 Never let yourself doubt upon that point
 Never trust to general impressions
 Neville St
 Neville wrote those words
 Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake
 No
 No crime
 No doubt you will go to the prison to see James
 No one but Mr
 No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted
 No one else
 No one is stirring yet
 No one knows a word of the matter
 No reference to the matter at all
 No servant would stay with us
 No sound came from within
 No wind
 Not a word of news came for a year and more
 Not even your skill can inform me where she is now
 Not more than is usual in my family
 Nothing but energy can save you
 Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady
 Nothing definite
 Nothing had been said during our drive
 Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour
 Nothing of the sort
 Nothing simpler
 Nothing to complain of
 Nothing was left save a few acres of ground
 Now
 Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age
 Now I have told you all my adventures
 Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey
 Now carry out my orders to the letter
 Now do try to come
 Now for the 
 Now for the facts
 Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den
 Now from this double point our research must commence
 Now he looks a little more human
 Now her marriage would mean
 Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of
 Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night
 Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it
 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St
 Now the question is
 Now turn that up in the ledger
 Now we can talk in safety

 Now where did you get them from
 O
 Oakshott
 Oakshott for it
 Oakshott here and I
 Oakshott to-night
 Obviously something had occurred during the morning
 Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it
 Of all these varied cases
 Of course
 Of course I might have fled from the house
 Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him
 Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim
 Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime
 Of course there is only one feasible explanation
 Of her I could see nothing
 Of my mother
 Of these
 Of these bedrooms the first is Dr
 Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope
 Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer
 Off I set to him
 Oh
 Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview
 Old as is the idea
 On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins
 On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared
 On entering his room
 On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
 On examining it
 On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool
 On my way I saw William Crowder
 On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways
 On returning
 On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick
 On the contrary
 On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table
 On the inside of the cover was a paper label
 On the inside of the flap he wrote 
 On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner
 On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
 On the left ran a lane which led to the stables
 On the next occasion
 On the one hand
 On the other hand
 On the right side was a small wooden thicket
 On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open
 On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom
 On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches
 On the whole
 Once only had I known him to fail
 Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled
 One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic
 One day
 One day he had met me
 One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis
 One evening
 One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool
 One is to a firm in the City
 One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly
 One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans
 One of the farms which he held
 One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled
 One of the gold corners
 One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it
 One of the latter knocked off the man
 One of them held the horse
 One of these
 One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat
 One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another
 One was an old woman
 One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
 One was the fact that his father should
 One would think they were the only geese in the world
 Only one man knew my secret
 Opening it hurriedly
 Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed
 Ordering my cab to wait
 Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states
 Our cabs were dismissed
 Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him
 Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors
 Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal
 Our own door flew open
 Our party is complete
 Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office
 Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman
 Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
 Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light
 Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered
 Out there fell a cascade of children
 Outside
 Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
 Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut
 Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 
 Pall Mall
 Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession
 Pancras Hotel
 Paramore
 Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river
 Patience Moran
 Paul
 Pennsylvania
 People tell me that I have spoiled him
 Perhaps
 Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up
 Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook
 Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him
 Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so
 Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner
 Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman
 Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
 Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right
 Peterson
 Peterson had rushed forward to protect the strange
 Petrified with astonishment

 Presently he came to himself once more
 Presently he emerged
 Presently she emerged from the room again

 Private affliction also is the lot of every man
 Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his

 Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band
 Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped

 Roylott
 Roylott entirely while we resided with him
 Roylott had gone to his room early
 Roylott has gone to town
 Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
 Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran
 Roylott was in India he married my mother
 Rucastle
 Rucastle and much less amiable
 Rucastle are going on a visit
 Rucastle at once
 Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
 Rucastle came out to me
 Rucastle coming out through this door
 Rucastle drew down the blind
 Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it
 Rucastle is not mad
 Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you
 Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches
 Rucastle seemed to be a very kind
 Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature
 Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it
 Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day
 Rucastle survived
 Rucastle that she could do nothing with him
 Rucastle then
 Rucastle to be back before three
 Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze
 Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother
 Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door
 Rucastle were both downstairs
 Running up

 Ryder instantly gave the alarm
 Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face

 Serpentine Avenue
 Set the pips on McCauley
 Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point
 Shall be glad if you will come with me
 She became restive
 She came to Mr
 She came with an excellent character
 She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out
 She could trust her own guardianship
 She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry
 She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
 She had a considerable sum of money--not less than 
 She had engaged a sitting-room
 She had gone off with a man
 She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs
 She had hardly said the words when young Mr
 She had married a man named Oakshott
 She had small round
 She had the surest information that of late he had
 She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep
 She has heard of you
 She has her freedom
 She has the face of the most beautiful of women
 She heard Mr
 She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent
 She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered
 She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse
 She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet
 She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place
 She is an American and came from California with her
 She is even more affected than I
 She is four-and-twenty
 She is herself the very soul of delicacy
 She is impetuous--volcanic
 She is my niece
 She is my right hand
 She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions
 She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet
 She is waiting now in the sitting-room
 She is what we call in England a tomboy
 She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives
 She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched
 She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way
 She left her room
 She left this morning with her husband by the 
 She listened for an instant
 She little knew what
 She lives quietly
 She never came back
 She passed down the stairs
 She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it
 She raised her dark eyebrows
 She raised her veil as she spoke
 She responded beautifully
 She rose at once
 She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
 She said nothing
 She sits in her own little office
 She smiled
 She smiled back at me
 She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question
 She states that while she was there she saw
 She stood smiling
 She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light
 She struck a gong upon the table
 She told him of the coronet
 She used to be at the Allegro
 She was a nonentity
 She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead
 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind
 She was bound to have me in
 She was but thirty at the time of her death
 She was flattered by the gentleman
 She was passing the front pew at the time
 She was plainly but neatly dressed
 She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
 She was rather above the middle height
 She was slighted like and had no say in anything
 She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool
 She was there in an instant
 She was very independent in little matters like that
 She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham
 She will not be up
 She would like advice
 She would often be lost in deep thought
 She would rush to secure it
 She writhed as one who is in terrible pain
 She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married
 Sherlock Holmes
 Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning
 Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet
 Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and
 Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick
 Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime
 Sherlock Holmes staggered back
 Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over
 Sherlock Holmes was a man
 Sherlock Holmes was able
 Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down
 Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform
 Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force
 Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable
 Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman
 Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard
 Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe

 Simon
 Simon 
 Simon alone
 Simon and his wedding
 Simon bitterly
 Simon came to 
 Simon glanced over it
 Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
 Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding
 Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor
 Simon has not already arrived
 Simon in particular
 Simon is a myth
 Simon marriage
 Simon marriage case
 Simon said something about 
 Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead
 Simon shook his head
 Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows
 Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own
 Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank
 Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position
 Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar
 Since you ask me
 Singularity is almost invariably a clue
 Sir
 Sir George Burnwell
 Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately
 Sir George Burnwell tried to get away
 Sit down and let us talk it over
 Sit down in that armchair
 Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street
 Smack
 Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind
 So
 So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them
 So I think
 So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased t
 So and so
 So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered
 So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St
 So far I was clear
 So he sat as I dropped off to sleep
 So long
 So long was he that Mr
 So much for the police-court
 So much is fairly clear
 So now
 So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery
 So perfect was the organisation of t
 So say the Serpentine-mews
 So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway
 So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived
 So there were quarrels
 So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
 Some
 Some five years ago
 Some friend of yours
 Some letters get more worn than others
 Some little distance down Threadneedle Street
 Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper
 Some of the general public were present
 Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier
 Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall
 Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St
 Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern
 Sometimes Holmes would hurry on
 Sometimes I think that I am myself

 Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls
 Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
 Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
 Suddenly
 Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage
 Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
 Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St
 Supposing that this unhappy young man
 Surely your medical experience would tell you
 Swiftly I threw off my clothes
 Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows
 THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
 Take a pinch of snuff
 Take your pistol
 Tell us the truth
 Tell us what you can
 Thank you
 That
 That and a tooth-brush are
 That bears out his story
 That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown
 That carries us right on to the other block
 That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done
 That fatal night Dr
 That he should come to me for help
 That is The Cedars
 That is all
 That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families
 That is clear and concise
 That is easily done
 That is for the court to decide
 That is his main fault
 That is how he did it
 That is important
 That is interesting
 That is just my point
 That is obvious
 That is quite cleared up now--though
 That is quite settled
 That is the only drawback which we have found to her
 That is the true story
 That is very bad
 That is very interesting
 That is what Mr
 That is what makes me uneasy
 That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night
 That is why I was so out of breath
 That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place
 That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled
 That second window is the one that I jumped from
 That sounded ominous
 That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it
 That the writer was on board of a ship
 That trick of staining the fishes
 That was a week ago
 That was always the way
 That was last Friday
 That was the name
 That was the word the man uttered
 That was to some extent in favour of the accused
 That will be next Monday
 That will just show you how fond he was of me
 The 
 The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round
 The Copper Beeches
 The Duke
 The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station
 The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged
 The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents
 The Rucastles will be gone by that time
 The alarm
 The alarm of fire was admirably done
 The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below
 The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor
 The bird gave a gulp
 The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance
 The blow was struck from immediately behind
 The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown
 The body exhibited no traces of violence
 The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates
 The bride
 The bride gave me a sovereign
 The bridge
 The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived
 The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him
 The case has
 The case would then never go into court at all
 The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston
 The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head
 The cellar
 The central portion was in little better repair
 The centre door was closed
 The ceremony
 The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr
 The chimney is wide
 The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us
 The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world
 The crate upon which I sit contains 
 The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
 The culprit is--
 The daughter told us as much
 The daughter was of a good
 The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle
 The devil knows best what he said
 The discovery that this was a dummy
 The distinction is clear
 The dog is let loose at n
 The door itself was locked as well
 The double line a little above the wrist
 The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys
 The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
 The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day
 The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes
 The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes
 The facts are these
 The fire was burning brightly
 The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you
 The first had walked both ways
 The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom
 The fund was
 The furniture was scattered about in every direction
 The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr
 The gentleman
 The goose
 The goose we retained until this morning
 The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped
 The group of trees
 The habit grew upon him
 The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon
 The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes
 The husband was a teetotaler
 The idea of a snake instantly
 The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training
 The incident however
 The initials were
 The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son
 The inspector and two men accompanied her back
 The inspector sat down at his desk
 The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us
 The instant that we heard it
 The lady
 The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him
 The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough
 The lamps had been lit
 The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o
 The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler
 The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr
 The lash
 The last squire dragged out his existence there
 The latter is always instructive
 The latter led to another broad passage
 The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends
 The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St
 The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
 The lining had been of red silk
 The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
 The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked
 The machine goes readily enough
 The man
 The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt
 The man seemed surprised
 The manor-house is
 The marks are perfectly fresh
 The matter is a perfectly trivial one
 The matter passed
 The men had known each other in the colonies
 The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
 The method was no doubt suggested to Clay
 The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants
 The more featureless and commonplace a crime is
 The most lay silent
 The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
 The name is no doubt familiar to you
 The name was strange to him
 The next instant I threw myself through
 The night
 The one unpleasant thing about the house
 The only drawback is that there is no law
 The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for
 The other clothes would have followed
 The other dived down the hole
 The other was his singular dying reference to a rat
 The others are Finns and Germans
 The panel had closed again behind me
 The passage outside was empty
 The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now
 The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull
 The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire
 The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
 The pipe was still between his lips
 The place we want must be somewhere near that line
 The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact
 The point is
 The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it
 The possession of a grey garment was a third point which
 The presence of the gipsies
 The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish
 The prisoner lay with his face towards us
 The puny plot of the story was so thin
 The question now was
 The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also
 The rest is of the greyish colour
 The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank
 The ring
 The road is an important highway
 The road topped a low hill
 The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward
 The rooms were carefully examined
 The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson
 The same porter was on duty
 The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse 
 The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 
 The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
 The sel
 The sewing-machine
 The shutters cut off the least ray of light
 The sight of the safe
 The singular incident made
 The skylight above was open
 The sleeper half turned
 The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia
 The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night
 The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there
 The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel
 The son
 The speckled band
 The stage lost a fine actor
 The story has
 The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand
 The streets will be crowded
 The sun was shining very brightly
 The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy
 The table was set out ready for me
 The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady
 The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door
 The tip had been cut off
 The total income
 The trap drove on
 The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots
 The unusual salary
 The very first key fitted to perfection
 The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair
 The walls were carefully sounded
 The walls were of wood
 The whole garden has already been minutely examined
 The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr
 The will is very clear upon that point
 The wind was howling outside
 The window was open
 The woman was standing in the aperture
 The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators
 The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
 The writing is undoubtedly my uncle
 Their papers they mean to have
 Then
 Then I
 Then I asked him who Mr
 Then I called at the offices round
 Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy
 Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer
 Then I looked in upon your son
 Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London
 Then I rang the bell
 Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
 Then I seized my coat
 Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night
 Then I thought of the whistle
 Then I thought of you
 Then I walked across to the window
 Then I walked to the other end
 Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do
 Then Lord St
 Then Mr
 Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings
 Then at the gasfitters
 Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand
 Then he became a little more reasonable
 Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
 Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St
 Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled
 Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad
 Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel
 Then he lit his pipe
 Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St
 Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow
 Then he sealed it and addressed it to 
 Then he stepped into the cab
 Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
 Then he struck gold
 Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack
 Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe
 Then he tried the various keys in the lock
 Then he turned down the lamp
 Then he turned the handle and entered
 Then he turned to me
 Then he walked slowly up the street
 Then here are the father
 Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it
 Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line
 Then it was that the lust of the chase w
 Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared
 Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
 Then my friend rose and threw open the door
 Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones
 Then she got better at last
 Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom
 Then something suddenly snapped
 Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle
 Then suddenly he plunged forward
 Then suddenly realising the exposure
 Then the charge against him will break down
 Then the fact that the two men were never together
 Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared
 Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one
 Then there is no more to be done in the matter
 Then there was a loud and authoritative tap
 Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
 Then they will not lose a minute
 Then when you hear him retire for the night
 Then who could this American be
 Then with a red head of hair
 Then with his lens he tested the hinges
 Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
 There
 There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life
 There are fourteen other characteristics
 There are grounds round it
 There are no further particulars
 There are not many in London which charge at that rate
 There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest
 There are only two
 There are rumours of foul play in the matter
 There are several other indications
 There are several people in the neighbourhood
 There are several singular points about the case
 There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force
 There are windows in it
 There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship
 There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which
 There cannot be any missing
 There could be no doubt that
 There could be no possible reason
 There has been no result
 There have been two murders
 There he is
 There he was
 There he was to be found
 There is
 There is Mortimer
 There is a comfortable sofa
 There is a date
 There is a distinct element of danger
 There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
 There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify
 There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia
 There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 
 There is a trap-door at the back of that building
 There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men
 There is a woodcock
 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace
 There is half a column of print
 There is no communication between them
 There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience
 There is no good for you to do
 There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child
 There is no other
 There is no reason
 There is no sign of any other weapon
 There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way
 There is not
 There is not an instant to be lost
 There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night
 There is one point which I should wish to determine
 There is one remarkable point
 There is only one point on which I must insist
 There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him
 There is something distinctly novel about some of the features
 There is that double possibility
 There is the first volume of it in that press
 There it is
 There it is in a nutshell
 There must be some strong reason behind
 There must have been several in it
 There only remains Mrs
 There the matter stands at present
 There was a cheetah
 There was a double stream upon the stair
 There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner
 There was a little shed in the yard
 There was a moment
 There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back
 There was a rush
 There was an old chest of drawers in the room
 There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage
 There was but one way for it
 There was never any mystery in the matter
 There was no furniture save a little pallet bed
 There was no maker
 There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe
 There was no rest for me
 There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken
 There was no sign of any violence
 There was no sign of him there
 There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar
 There was no truth
 There was not a bird to be seen there
 There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman
 There was nothing
 There was nothing else save the five dried pips
 There was one about three miles off
 There was one singular exception
 There was one wing
 There was only one thing in it
 There was something else which she would fain have said
 There was the end of this tangled clue
 There was the huge famished brute
 There was the point from which all my adventures started
 There were
 There were Sherlock Holmes
 There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock
 There were four of them in a row
 There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red
 There were meetings
 There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor
 There were no signs of violence
 There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments
 There were six of us
 There were six troopers and six of us
 There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months
 There will probably be some small unpleasantness
 There would be a noise like a pistol shot
 There would be one to Reading in less than an hour
 There you are
 There you must stay
 Therefore he used a holder
 Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell
 Therein lies my metier
 These
 These are daring men
 These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat
 These articles
 These flat brims curled at the edge came in then
 These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine
 These little problems help me to do so
 These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous
 They all appear to be adhesive
 They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives
 They are a most unpleasant couple
 They are all
 They are all typewritten
 They are important
 They are not very exacting
 They are the devil
 They come
 They could only have come from the old man at my side
 They did not know how to look
 They drove away in different directions
 They each led into an empty room
 They got 
 They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
 They have been identified as her clothes
 They have laid for five
 They have now fled together
 They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent
 They laid me on a couch
 They put in the advertisement
 They say that away down in the village
 They spoke of those hours of burrowing
 They still live with their old servants
 They talk of woman
 They were a gang
 They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men
 They were all engaged for the evening
 They were all horrible to me
 They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar
 They were always very careful
 They were evidently all deserted
 They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper
 They were on the upper floor
 They were waiting for me in the drawing-room
 They will see that you are not there
 Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window
 Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty
 This American had started from London when he was young
 This account of you we have from all quarters received
 This also was opened
 This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you
 This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside
 This business at Coburg Square is serious
 This business has had a very bad effect upon him
 This case
 This child
 This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar
 This dust
 This fellow
 This fellow is madly
 This fellow will not go wrong again
 This gentleman
 This ground in front belongs to the house
 This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens
 This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him
 This incident gives zest to our investigation
 This is more interesting than it promised to be
 This is my friend and colleague
 This is my intimate friend and associate
 This is my point
 This is no time for despair
 This is not such a populous neighbourhood
 This is only where we compress it
 This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den
 This is very interesting
 This is what began it all
 This is what he says
 This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie
 This man
 This man has written the name
 This man strikes even deeper
 This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him
 This morning he was removed to a cell
 This note I had this morning marks my zero-point
 This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner
 This press
 This ring--
 This stone is not yet twenty years old
 This strange
 This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War
 This was clearly the cause of the loss of power
 This way
 This we have now been doing for some time
 This woman might
 This would be in the year 
 This year our good host
 Those
 Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride
 Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends
 Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court
 Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear
 Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb
 Three gilt balls and a brown board with 
 Three gone before you could wink
 Three of our boys were killed
 Three thousand will cover the matter
 Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr
 Tiptoes
 To Holmes
 To be left till called for
 To carry the art
 To do this
 To me
 To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged
 To me it has been exceptionally so
 To speak plainly
 To take the first example to hand
 To the best of his belief
 To-day is Saturday
 To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case
 Together we rushed into the room
 Toller
 Toller in the cellar
 Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else
 Toller lets him loose every night
 Toller serenely
 Too large for easy concealment about a woman
 Too little
 Too narrow for anyone to pass through
 Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame
 Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time
 Turner
 Turner had a considerable household
 Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you
 Turner made his money
 Turner was apparently the richer man
 Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp
 Twelve struck
 Twenty-four geese at 
 Twenty-nine
 Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
 Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
 Twice he was walking
 Twice my boy has asked her to marry him
 Twice she has been waylaid
 Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk
 Two attempts of the sort have already been made
 Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building
 Two days later--that is
 Two hansoms were standing at the door
 Two hours passed slowly away
 Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount
 Two years ago
 U
 Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested
 Unless they are quite new
 Until after the alarm of fire
 Up to a late hour last night
 Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major
 Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge
 Very few governesses in England are getting 
 Very likely I have
 Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year
 Very much so
 Very retiring and gentlemanly he was
 Very right
 Victor Hatherley
 Victoria Street 
 Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up
 Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful
 Violence does
 Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family
 Visited Paramore
 Voila tout
 Wait in patience
 Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration
 Was dressed
 Was dressed in
 Was it all to go for nothing
 Was it not extraordinary
 Was it possible that we could bring him back to her
 Was it to be in church
 Was she his client
 Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
 Was there a police-station anywhere near
 Watson
 Watson and I will follow in the second
 Watson has not heard the opening 
 Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain
 We are at present
 We are but preventing her from injuring another
 We are faddy people
 We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
 We are spies in an enemy
 We are willing to give 
 We both sprang in
 We called at the door
 We can
 We can do nothing until seven o
 We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me
 We compress the earth into bricks
 We could write in the meantime
 We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge
 We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave
 We even traced them as far as Reading
 We feed him once a day
 We found him
 We found the brass box there
 We got away with the gold
 We got into a cab together
 We got to the church first
 We guard our secret very jealously
 We had
 We had driven several miles
 We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound
 We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
 We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 
 We had walked several times up and down the lawn
 We have a housekeeper now
 We have a seven-mile drive before us
 We have already a clue
 We have already had experience of such
 We have boxed the compass among us
 We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry
 We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak
 We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years
 We have had some skirmishes
 We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits
 We have known each other since we were little children
 We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to
 We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night
 We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
 We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa
 We live very quietly
 We lunch at Swindon
 We may take it
 We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her
 We must come back to that
 We must have a look at it
 We neither of us care for it
 We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street
 We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him
 We shall now have a little supper and then retire
 We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you
 We shall soon see how he managed it
 We shall then look thoroughly into the affair
 We shall want you to come to-night by the last train
 We should be rich men if we had 
 We should have acted before this
 We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find
 We stepped
 We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
 We waited
 We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah
 We were all assembled round him when the door opened
 We were engaged after the first walk that we took
 We were engaged to each other
 We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in
 We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over
 We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady
 We will talk about that
 We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence
 Well
 Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand
 Westaway was the name of the founder of the business
 What a queen she would have made
 What a shrimp it is
 What a strange idea
 What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was
 What a week she must have spent
 What an exposure
 What are you going to do yourself
 What can I do
 What can this be
 What can you gather from this old battered felt
 What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article
 What could be the reason of his overpowering terror
 What could have happened
 What could it be
 What could that mean
 What could that something be
 What d
 What danger do you foresee
 What did she do on re-entering her father
 What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep
 What did they say
 What did you do
 What did you understand by that
 What do you deduce from it
 What do you deduce from that
 What do you mean
 What do you think
 What do you think of such a commission as that
 What do you want
 What does her clever stepfather do then
 What else could she do
 What has she been saying to you
 What have we here
 What is it
 What is this
 What of it
 What sundial
 What was he doing there at all
 What was that
 What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel
 What was the relation between them
 What was this nocturnal expedition
 What will he say when he returns
 What would he do then
 Whatever he wanted he must have
 When
 When I came down
 When I came to I found that it was still bleeding
 When I cried out that it was a false alarm
 When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him
 When I had listened to all they had to tell
 When I had made it clear to them
 When I have spun the web they may take the flies
 When I passed outside
 When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business
 When I remembered that you had seen her at that window
 When I rose from my father I looked round for it
 When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St
 When I saw how many were waiting
 When I see you
 When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
 When I was alone once more
 When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation
 When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals
 When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates
 When a woman thinks that her house is on fire
 When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of 
 When an actor I had
 When he breathed his vows to her
 When he came to the highroad at the other end
 When he reached my sister
 When he told us of a man in a pew
 When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me
 When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club
 When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa
 When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love
 When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties
 When she wouldn
 When the inspector and a constable entered the house
 When these hot fits were over
 When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors
 When you raise your cry of fire
 Where are the gems
 Where are the jewels which you have stolen
 Where are they
 Where are we to find the photograph
 Where does the thing come from
 Where is your father
 Where were we going
 Which was it
 While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane
 Who are you
 Who could come to-night
 Who do you give your casting vote to
 Who is this K
 Who were these German people
 Who would have believed it
 Who would have ever believed it
 Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison
 Whoa
 Whom have I the honour to address
 Whose
 Why
 Why should I attempt to conceal it
 Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission
 Why should she hand it over to anyone else
 Why should they give you 
 Will you be ready to-morrow
 Will you not wait and breakfast
 William Morris or Mr
 Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered
 Wilson
 Wimpole Street
 Windibank
 Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball
 Windibank came he made her sell the business
 Windibank did not wish us to go
 Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother
 Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves
 Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat
 Windibank--that is
 Windigate
 Windigate by name
 Windigate of the Alpha
 With a boy
 With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way
 With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way
 With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
 With a rending
 With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him
 With a stout bearing
 With an apology for my intrusion
 With hardly a word spoken
 With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us
 With his collar turned up
 With much labour we separated them and carried him
 With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another
 With that he seized my hair in both his hands
 With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
 With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks
 With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan
 With this intention
 With trembling hands I undid my trunk
 With your permission
 Within are the very words which were upon my father
 Within there was a small corridor
 Within was a small
 Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage
 Women are naturally secretive
 Would she not have made an admirable queen
 Would the body be dressed in a coat alone
 Would you give me an introduction to him
 Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr
 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book
 Yes
 Yet
 Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind
 Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
 Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol
 Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features
 Yet it was quite certain
 Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power
 Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit
 Yet we have not a moment to lose
 Yet when I spoke to her of the matter
 Yet when I think of him in cold blood
 You
 You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers
 You are Holmes
 You are a funny one
 You are doing what you can for him and for me
 You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs
 You are in my power
 You are not averse to this trip
 You are probably aware that fuller
 You are screening your stepfather
 You are to station yourself close to that open window
 You are too timid in drawing your inferences
 You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes
 You bring Mrs
 You can leave your bag
 You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
 You can understand that
 You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South
 You cannot imagine how comical he was
 You did not know where to look
 You did not see anyone else in the room
 You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
 You do not know her
 You do not mean bodies
 You don
 You fail
 You give me hopes
 You had heard
 You have been brought there to personate someone
 You have been looking a little pale lately
 You have been of material assistance to me
 You have been reading the papers diligently of late
 You have come in by train this morning
 You have come up from the south-west
 You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
 You have dishonoured me forever
 You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
 You have formed some conclusion
 You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes
 You have heard something
 You have him here
 You have lost nothing by them
 You have made two blunders in as many minutes
 You have made your statement very clearly
 You have no further evidence
 You have not observed
 You have really done very well indeed
 You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle
 You have worked with it
 You heard him yourselves to-night
 You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart
 You just read it for yourself
 You knew that this man Horner
 You know Peterson
 You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing
 You know my methods
 You know what woman
 You look at these scattered houses
 You look cold
 You made some small job in my lady
 You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
 You may go to any expense which you think necessary
 You may know the strict principles of her family
 You may remember the old Persian saying
 You may safely trust him
 You may set your mind at rest about that
 You may then walk to the end of the street
 You may walk to the cab
 You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle
 You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them
 You must be weary
 You must find your own ink
 You must get home instantly and act
 You must have started early
 You must lock yourself up from him to-night
 You must not interfere
 You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described
 You must yourself have remarked how worn
 You need not
 You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger
 You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad
 You put me off
 You quite follow me
 You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr
 You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle
 You said it should not be again
 You said ten miles
 You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
 You saw her return by the kitchen door
 You say so
 You say that there was a gentleman in the pew
 You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in
 You see
 You see all these isolated facts
 You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee
 You see no difficulty
 You see that we have been as good as our word
 You see this little book
 You see this other page in red ink
 You see we have already arrived
 You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price
 You seem to have done the thing very completely
 You shave every morning
 You should be ashamed of yourself
 You should have been a surgeon
 You suppose that your son came down from his bed
 You surprise me
 You then--
 You took me in completely
 You understand
 You want to know what became of those geese
 You were chosen
 You will ask me why I did not dispose of it
 You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor
 You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard
 You will find it here
 You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room
 You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
 You will find parallel cases
 You will first make a note
 You will leave the papers here
 You will sign it
 You won
 You would certainly have been burned
 Young McCarthy must be got off
 Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged
 Your Majesty
 Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
 Your Majesty will
 Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
 Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me
 Your duties
 Your husband
 Your life may depend upon your compliance
 Your news of this morning
 Your niece
 Your niece knew nothing of such men
 Your own opinion is
 Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated
 Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left
 Your salary with me
 Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it
 Your task is confined to that
 Your wedding was arranged
 Your wife has been waiting this two days for you
 Your windows would be visible from there
 Yours faithfully

 although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain
 although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us
 although he has now fallen upon evil days
 although it was reported as having cleared from London
 although its contents had been destroyed
 although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date
 although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink
 although they impressed me in his favour and you against him
 although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine
 amiable disposition
 amid all the hubbub of the gale
 among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house
 amount to 
 an American gentleman
 an absolutely desperate villain
 an armchair beside the bed
 an aunt
 an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives
 an old briar pipe between his lips
 an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees
 an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box

 and God help you in your undertaking

 and Horner was arrested the same evening
 and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone

 and I am acting in her interests
 and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has
 and I am likely to be busier still this evening
 and I am living with my stepfather
 and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
 and I am not easy in my mind about them
 and I am ready enough to tell what I know
 and I am very sorry if I have given you pain
 and I answered advertisements
 and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League
 and I assure you that they were identical
 and I beg that you won
 and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him
 and I came down
 and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all
 and I can
 and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
 and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
 and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
 and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn
 and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out
 and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike
 and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief
 and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure
 and I could at once see that someone had passed out
 and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
 and I could easily get her out of the way
 and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
 and I could never tell them apart
 and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller
 and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke
 and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
 and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy
 and I determined to do just whatever he might direct
 and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey
 and I drew the drawer open
 and I examined the machine very thoroughly
 and I fear that Neville St
 and I feel that I must leave you forever
 and I fell into the garden below
 and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop
 and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting
 and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact
 and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor
 and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
 and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family
 and I had not got mine yet
 and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk
 and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
 and I had two police fellows there in private clothes
 and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica
 and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred
 and I have been shamefully used
 and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time
 and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
 and I have got it in this Gladstone bag
 and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner 
 and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
 and I have more than once taken advantage of it
 and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him
 and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
 and I have no doubt that is her ring
 and I have no idea how he came by his injuries
 and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up
 and I have not seen her si
 and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
 and I have seldom seen a better grown goose
 and I have shown you how I trust you
 and I have taken it out
 and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away
 and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts
 and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion
 and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me
 and I instantly lit the light and attacked it
 and I just on with my things and came right away to you
 and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions
 and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage
 and I knew that he was writing me a note
 and I knew that she was always as good as her word
 and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter
 and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred
 and I know his faults as no one else does
 and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him
 and I laughed until I was quite weary
 and I made for my sister
 and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own
 and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
 and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown
 and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
 and I must be quick
 and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter
 and I on you
 and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door
 and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
 and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her
 and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found
 and I pointed it out to my companions
 and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it
 and I poured out some water from a caraffe
 and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge
 and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o
 and I remain
 and I repeat to-day
 and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked
 and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air
 and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher
 and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
 and I sent it to the firm
 and I set myself to do a little good with my money
 and I shall be happy to look into it
 and I shall be with you in an instant
 and I shall be with you presently
 and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning
 and I shall continue with my miserable story
 and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester
 and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee
 and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
 and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance
 and I shall work mine
 and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means
 and I should not think of leaving
 and I should value your advice
 and I should--
 and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap
 and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
 and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers
 and I stood gazing at Holmes
 and I think
 and I think I shall just treat myself to--
 and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time
 and I think that she must have been one
 and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure
 and I thought that
 and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen
 and I took the advice of my assistant
 and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
 and I trust
 and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you
 and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress
 and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men
 and I volunteered to supply them
 and I want to introspect
 and I want you to start upon your work knowing it
 and I was always glad of a bit of news
 and I was at my wit
 and I was aware
 and I was determined to see which
 and I was feeling which was the fattest
 and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb
 and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau
 and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door
 and I was quickly between the sheets
 and I was shown out by the page
 and I was very sick for months after
 and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes
 and I went back to Pa
 and I went off to make my own arrangements
 and I will not
 and I will pay it
 and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can
 and I will rejoin you in ten minutes
 and I will show you the steps by which I reached it
 and I wish to speak with him
 and I won
 and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr
 and I would go
 and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business
 and I would not have missed it for a good deal
 and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London
 and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision
 and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here
 and Lady Alicia Whittington
 and McFarlane
 and Miss Hatty Doran
 and Mr
 and Mrs
 and Pa was very pleased
 and Peterson
 and Pope
 and Toller will
 and Tudor on the distaff side
 and Turner had an only daughter of the same age
 and Watson here can witness it
 and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
 and a basketful of linen
 and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself
 and a broad
 and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope
 and a chronicler still more so
 and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
 and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window
 and a drunken-looking groom
 and a few minutes after I found
 and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door
 and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
 and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal
 and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock
 and a few moments later a clanging sound
 and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability
 and a fringe of little black jet ornaments
 and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar
 and a gentleman sprang out
 and a hesitating
 and a lady
 and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies
 and a large 
 and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear
 and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye
 and a little blonde woman stood in the opening
 and a long
 and a long mirror
 and a look of infinite languor in his face
 and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round
 and a low voice whispered
 and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation
 and a man of great personal beauty
 and a man who is popular with all who know him
 and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself
 and a marriage was arranged
 and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm
 and a most remarkable bird it proved
 and a note for me lay upon the hall table
 and a pair of high gaiters
 and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes
 and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
 and a perpetual smell of drink
 and a pile of crumpled morning papers
 and a register
 and a rough one
 and a sad
 and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet
 and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
 and a slight defect in the tail of the

 and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
 and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds
 and a tall

 and abode of my morning visitor
 and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger

 and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed
 and after
 and after much chaffering I got our stones at 
 and after that we met him--that is to say
 and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors
 and afterwards from your gesture
 and afterwards under Hood
 and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire
 and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views
 and all the proofs which I could possibly need
 and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones
 and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House
 and all went as well as possible with us until the January of 
 and also a pair of the son
 and also in a facility of repartee
 and also in the Arnsworth Castle business
 and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
 and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years
 and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions
 and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition
 and among them Miss Turner
 and an appropriate dress
 and an elderly woman stood upon the steps
 and an engagement
 and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
 and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
 and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt
 and any others that occur to you
 and are then shown in one by one
 and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key
 and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above
 and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
 and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station
 and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice
 and as I was known to be in weak health
 and as Lord St
 and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him
 and as he was watching me narrowly
 and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot
 and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
 and as much knowledge of the world
 and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it
 and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up
 and as soon as 
 and as such I had influence over him
 and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four
 and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven
 and as the country was unknown to him

 and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me
 and at the same instant Mrs

 and at the silence Holmes
 and away we dashed down the London Road
 and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square
 and away we went as fast as the horse could go
 and be brave
 and be in the act of throwing it out
 and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
 and became a piteous spectacle
 and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear
 and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol
 and before he really knew her

 and finally that C was visited
 and finding that he would not tell me the story
 and followed him
 and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quart
 and for a long time we did all the work of the house

 and found him standing by the pool
 and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described
 and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate
 and from that time I have not sat again in the window

 and from the time that we took

 and had almost come to believe that Mrs
 and had always been his friend
 and had been famous in the green-room for my skill
 and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
 and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene
 and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday
 and had this unfortunate man arrested
 and has always given me satisfaction
 and has had no hat since
 and has just been serving his time in Pentonville
 and has not been heard of since
 and hastened downstairs
 and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter
 and have now married her
 and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him
 and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver
 and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father
 and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife
 and having met you succeeded by certain arguments
 and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred
 and he
 and he at me
 and he bent her to his will
 and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe
 and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
 and he closed the door as we entered
 and he did not know when he would return
 and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him
 and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs
 and he gave a little cry of satisfaction
 and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand
 and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--
 and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
 and he had come back
 and he had fixed it all up so nicely
 and he had no friends of any sort
 and he had told the man that he must hurry
 and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon
 and he has been in failing health for some time
 and he has blasted my life
 and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
 and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
 and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius
 and he lay there
 and he left a tidy business behind him
 and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
 and he misses me so if I leave him
 and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone
 and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
 and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
 and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it
 and he says
 and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
 and he seemed to know what I was thinking
 and he seemed to think
 and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
 and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
 and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right
 and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice
 and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers
 and he stuck to her as true as 
 and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat
 and he took me away to 
 and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle
 and he used to write every day
 and he wanted to do the old town a good turn
 and he was less inclined for any sort of society
 and he was seized and searched
 and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
 and he wore tinted glasses against the glare
 and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate
 and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople
 and he would not go to you
 and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
 and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
 and hence my preference for a dirty face
 and her expression was weary and haggard
 and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
 and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed
 and her little income
 and hereditary King of Bohemia
 and his age
 and his bearing assured
 and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
 and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
 and his chin sunk upon his breast
 and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them
 and his elbows upon his knees
 and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character
 and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand
 and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented
 and his face is as black as a tinker
 and his father
 and his father did not know where he wa
 and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers
 and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
 and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City
 and his high
 and his keen
 and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
 and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come
 and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears
 and his opponent at the other
 and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes
 and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood
 and his singular account of his father
 and his tie under his ear
 and his trick of vanishing into the cellar
 and his watch--all were there
 and his worn boots
 and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B
 and how all-important it was to set it right
 and how came the goose into the open market
 and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again
 and how the best plans of Mr
 and how they could get rid of what they stole
 and huge projecting bones
 and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room
 and hurried away
 and hurried down to the passage
 and hurried into the back yard
 and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed
 and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it
 and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house

 and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor

 and in that way has escaped destruction
 and in the carriage
 and in the cold dank air of the vault
 and in the grate there was a mass of black
 and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands

 and indeed was nodding myself

 and inquiry showed it was so

 and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
 and it could not be more than thirty feet down
 and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
 and it disappeared into the Thames
 and it fell over into the pew
 and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
 and it had left him with a weak throat
 and it has awakened me
 and it has lost a little of its force
 and it is also true that the initials 
 and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures
 and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us
 and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you
 and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance
 and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
 and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit
 and it need not interfere very much with one
 and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country
 and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye
 and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
 and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue
 and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more
 and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question
 and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 
 and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident
 and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street
 and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure
 and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones
 and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character
 and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now
 and it was there I met Mr
 and it widened the field of my inquiry
 and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up
 and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
 and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on
 and it would be impossible to replace them
 and its curious termination
 and its solution is its own reward
 and its value can only be conjectured
 and joined us in a hearty meal
 and just a little lower down was a long building
 and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices
 and keeps off other lovers by making love himself
 and knew all about him
 and knock sleepy people up out of their beds
 and ladies
 and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
 and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
 and laughed
 and lay half-fainting upon the other side
 and leading to the most outre results
 and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling
 and leave it to your deadliest enemy
 and led down a flight of winding stone steps
 and left the room
 and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain
 and let me know when you have done it
 and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark
 and light-coloured gaiters
 and little low doors
 and lived generally in good style
 and lived in Brixton Road
 and locked it again
 and locked the door of the office after me
 and looked out
 and looking about for the manager
 and made for the door
 and made our way over to England without being suspected
 and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal
 and marked with every evil passion
 and may be set aside altogether
 and may read it for yourself
 and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
 and met there a half-pay major of marines
 and mother said she would make it all right with him
 and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard
 and moving my chair a little sideways
 and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
 and my bedroom wall has been pierced
 and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
 and my father entered into possession of the estate
 and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
 and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever
 and my mind is made up that I will accept it
 and my poor little reputation
 and my son in one night
 and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points
 and my unhappy boy
 and my wife has given her notice
 and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment
 and myself
 and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa
 and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
 and no confession could make your guilt more heinous
 and no doubt it is a little worn
 and no harm done save the loss of a goose
 and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr
 and none the wiser
 and not Neville St
 and not a cloud in the sky
 and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action
 and not me
 and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone
 and not to abuse your patience
 and not to interfere
 and not too much then
 and nothing stranger than the result when viewed
 and occasionally
 and occasionally during the honeymoon
 and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues
 and of a most retiring disposition
 and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut
 and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
 and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind
 and of course there was but one way out of it
 and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family
 and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners
 and of how very useful they would be to me
 and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living
 and of some 
 and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
 and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House
 and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof
 and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me
 and of which his son only caught the last two syllables
 and often twice
 and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week
 and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor
 and on looking over the entries against him
 and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat
 and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad
 and on the side of it farthest from the thumb
 and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple
 and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
 and once by a woman
 and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
 and once he ran swiftly
 and one and two and three
 and one for us
 and one of them has the shutters up
 and one which is used between Australians
 and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand
 and only just had ti
 and only one wing is now inhabited
 and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree
 and others talked together in a strange
 and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any
 and our lunch awaited us upon the table
 and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang
 and out came my sister to know what was the matter
 and out into the bright morning sunshine
 and outstanding
 and over the broad gleaming Severn
 and peep in at the queer things which are going on
 and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
 and peering through the gloom
 and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street
 and perhaps just a little resentment
 and perhaps the house
 and perhaps write a little note
 and personally interested in the matter
 and pin-point pupils
 and pointed over the meadows
 and politics were marked at zero
 and possibly other large towns
 and presently
 and preserved her secret
 and pressed down the levers which controlled it
 and probably never will be
 and prosperity to your house
 and protested his innocence in the strongest terms
 and prying its bill open
 and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
 and put on my pigments and wig
 and quick march
 and quite time that we started
 and ran down the lane
 and ran thus
 and read the following paragraph
 and received in exchange twopence
 and remember the advice which I have given you
 and results all pointed to an abominable crime
 and returns at seven sharp for dinner
 and revolved slowly upon its hinges
 and right up to the steps which led to the office
 and rising from the table he retired to his room
 and rushed into the corridor
 and said that I was never to speak of the matter again
 and said there was no use denying anything to a woman
 and sallow-skinned
 and saw a large 
 and say
 and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
 and seen him driven through the darkness
 and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
 and send down to Fordham
 and sent them to mother
 and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of 
 and seven sheets of foolscap paper
 and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal
 and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom
 and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
 and shall probably return to London by the evening train
 and she could see that I was amused
 and she distinctly saw his face
 and she endeavoured to push her way in
 and she had no just cause of complaint against me
 and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point
 and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall
 and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
 and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father
 and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me
 and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor
 and she to her own house
 and she was escorted home in a cab by the police
 and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room
 and shrugged his shoulders
 and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
 and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it
 and sitting still
 and slipped through
 and slow
 and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently
 and so
 and so at last
 and so by the foot-path over the fields
 and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool
 and so had my girl
 and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up
 and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr
 and so may he
 and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part
 and so on of your own bird
 and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane
 and so systematic its methods
 and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them
 and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street
 and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street
 and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market
 and so uncertain as to his fate
 and so we came right away round to his 
 and so you missed all that was important
 and sobbed upon her shoulder
 and some coming back dejected
 and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours
 and some wear only on one side
 and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War
 and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise
 and spotted in several places
 and springing down
 and stained they were
 and start for Winchester to-morrow
 and started for the Temple to see my husband
 and started off
 and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
 and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall
 and straight into the arms of Mr
 and such a very positive one
 and such an expenditure as they were at
 and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived
 and suited me so well
 and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses
 and take him into my confidence
 and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table
 and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously
 and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table
 and terraced with wooden berths
 and that
 and that I can deduce all that remains
 and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery
 and that I should hear of Hosmer again
 and that I should send him away to his death--
 and that I was Miss Alice
 and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him
 and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
 and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
 and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us
 and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman
 and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance
 and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
 and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak
 and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation
 and that he uses lime-cream
 and that he was not to be cooped up
 and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks
 and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later
 and that he would see to anything that turned up
 and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
 and that his marriage might have changed his whole life
 and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia
 and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred
 and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats
 and that in such a very cocksure manner
 and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me
 and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star
 and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them
 and that it had ended with the last generation
 and that it is only found in one or two places in England
 and that it is still lying in our cellar
 and that it was a sign of his passion
 and that it was no more than his deserts
 and that it was possible that we might spend the night there
 and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
 and that of Colonel Warburton
 and that one particularly
 and that she
 and that she has known the bridegroom for some years
 and that she no longer desired his attentions
 and that she was afraid that they were going to fight
 and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
 and that the bed was clamped to the floor
 and that the clothes might betray me
 and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another
 and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents
 and that the door
 and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater
 and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr
 and that the play will be more exciting
 and that the small morocco casket in which
 and that the someone could not have been his son
 and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source
 and that the two may have planned the robbery
 and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him
 and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered
 and that there would be nothing to disturb you
 and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case
 and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel
 and that this is the only one which remains
 and that was enough
 and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
 and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret
 and that woman was the late Irene Adler
 and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
 and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
 and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw
 and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
 and that your circle of friends was a very limited one
 and the Freemasonry
 and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
 and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
 and the air of a man who is lost in thought
 and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
 and the anxiety in my mind tended
 and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair
 and the billet was such a good one
 and the blinds in the windows
 and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland
 and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots
 and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
 and the carriage came to a stand
 and the case must collapse
 and the chalk-pit unfenced
 and the child was with them
 and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands
 and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath
 and the colonel ushered me in
 and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
 and the colour of your hair
 and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife
 and the conversation soon flagged
 and the copying of the Encyclopaedia
 and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
 and the damp was breaking through in green
 and the date of his supposed suicide
 and the dawn be breaking above us
 and the dearest old country-house
 and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
 and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
 and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes
 and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence
 and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north
 and the evident confusion which the cripple showed
 and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features
 and the exquisite mouth
 and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet
 and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency
 and the fierce energy of his own keen nature
 and the flooring was also thoroughly examined
 and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager
 and the folks would fly at his approach
 and the goose came from Mr
 and the heading 
 and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment
 and the incident of the noble bachelor
 and the incident of the vanishing cloth
 and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
 and the key was not there
 and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
 and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge
 and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
 and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day
 and the lawyer took it away with him
 and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk
 and the little things that he would think of
 and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained
 and the loss of it would have made a serious difference
 and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter
 and the matter struck me as remarkable
 and the mind of the most resolute of men
 and the moment when
 and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes
 and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way
 and the morning broke bright and cloudless
 and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another
 and the muscles are more developed
 and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth
 and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger
 and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger
 and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming
 and the ominous words with which he had parted from me
 and the one next to the main building to Dr
 and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs
 and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there
 and the opposing windows loomed like dark
 and the other a plain one
 and the other at the first
 and the other was William Crowder
 and the paper upon which it was written
 and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
 and the prisoner gone
 and the proprietor a horsey-looking man
 and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St
 and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
 and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
 and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
 and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library
 and the rest is familiar to you
 and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze
 and the same the week after
 and the same thickness
 and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another
 and the sight sent a chill to my own heart
 and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
 and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground
 and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
 and the son was following him
 and the sound as of a large animal moving about
 and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
 and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves
 and the stone-work had been broken into
 and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city
 and the third from London
 and the third my own
 and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen
 and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
 and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face
 and the two constables at the door saluted him
 and the two-hundred-year-old house
 and the use of the word 
 and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
 and the veins stood out at his temples with passion
 and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long
 and the water was but two feet deep
 and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press
 and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer
 and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that
 and the whole place is in a blaze
 and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney
 and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
 and the windows were thick with the ice crystals
 and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear
 and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama
 and then
 and then 
 and then Frank went off to seek his fortune
 and then I heard of him from New Mexico
 and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me
 and then Mr
 and then a scream of agony
 and then afterwards they remembered us
 and then all was silent once more
 and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
 and then blotted
 and then closing it once more hurry back to her room
 and then composed himself
 and then conducted us down a dark
 and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures
 and then down again to the corner
 and then had gone away
 and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them
 and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back
 and then he left me
 and then he went prospecting in Arizona
 and then leaving me
 and then look back at me
 and then made my way to Mr
 and then off to violin-land
 and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver
 and then quick steps upon the linoleum
 and then returned
 and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered
 and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner
 and then settled down once more into a deep slumber
 and then suddenly
 and then suddenly tailing off into silence
 and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here
 and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going
 and then to the Church of St
 and then turn the key upon her
 and then turned upon my companion
 and then up at the open skylight
 and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
 and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs
 and then wandered through the streets of the little town
 and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy
 and there
 and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me
 and there are cigars in the box
 and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures
 and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums
 and there are the rose-bushes where I lay
 and there are usually people there
 and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
 and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address
 and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird
 and there he would take his exercise
 and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream
 and there is but a step between the crime and the dock
 and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
 and there is the address where you should apply for particulars
 and there isn
 and there it vanishes among the reeds
 and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak
 and there never has been
 and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
 and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
 and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since
 and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us
 and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake
 and there was a struggle between them
 and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks
 and there was my Frank
 and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
 and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations
 and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year
 and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other
 and there we found the young lady waiting for us
 and there were marks of many feet
 and there were no other traces of Mr
 and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket
 and there your bird
 and therefore we cannot count upon delay
 and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers
 and they are waiting for us
 and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body
 and they like to do their own secreting
 and they must have been men of resource and determination
 and they subdued the flames
 and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields
 and this
 and this I have endeavoured in my case to do
 and this also he carefully examined and retained
 and this he placed upon the bed beside him
 and this in itself implies
 and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open
 and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village
 and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice
 and though we meet signs of him at every turn
 and though we shall take them at a disadvantage
 and threw it down upon the table
 and throwing himself down into an armchair
 and throwing the noose round the reptile
 and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition
 and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper
 and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time
 and to follow the quick
 and to get away from the scene of uproar
 and to grown men
 and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
 and to have been under such obligations to Turner
 and to having rushed into the room
 and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers
 and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster
 and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future
 and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept
 and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
 and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed
 and to think over my plan of campaign
 and to wait you at the corner of the street
 and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
 and took his children over to America with him
 and took out
 and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
 and tugged until I yelled with the pain
 and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk
 and turned back to his chemical studies
 and turned his face towards us
 and turned the key in the lock
 and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
 and two dozen for the market
 and two or three bills upon the table
 and two people saw him as he passed over this ground
 and two years and eight months have elapsed since then
 and unkempt
 and ushering in a visitor
 and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
 and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road
 and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come
 and vanished into the darkness
 and ventilators which do not ventilate
 and very energetic inquiries are being made
 and vouching for things of which I knew nothing
 and vulgar enough
 and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me
 and was hanging by the hands to the sill
 and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child
 and was lying senseless
 and was not itself within the grounds at all
 and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand
 and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and
 and waving his arms
 and we all rushed down the stairs together
 and we all three read it together
 and we all very quietly entered the cell
 and we are to be married in the course of the spring
 and we both bent over the sheet of paper
 and we came to London
 and we can
 and we can have some lunch on the way
 and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
 and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation
 and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets
 and we drove for at least an hour
 and we got a knife and opened the goose
 and we had a wild
 and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor
 and we heard the sharp clang of the bell
 and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
 and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts
 and we lay in wait for it and attacked it
 and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us
 and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us
 and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street
 and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
 and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
 and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
 and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock
 and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
 and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first
 and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us
 and we shall soon have the trap out
 and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell
 and we shall soon see the end of this black business
 and we waited in absolute darkness
 and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
 and we were left in darkness
 and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady
 and we were only two years old at the time of my mother
 and we were shown up together to Holmes
 and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St
 and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
 and we will enter Dr
 and we will see what is to be made of this fellow
 and we will talk this matter over
 and we wish your advice upon the subject
 and well-cut pearl-grey trousers
 and went out
 and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child
 and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas
 and were mostly concerned with politics
 and were not to be connected with the warnings
 and were shown to be quite solid all round
 and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement
 and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever
 and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band
 and what happened when Mr
 and what have I gained
 and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
 and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine
 and what the object of his repeated visits
 and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
 and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland
 and what was it to them
 and what were they doing living in this strange
 and what were we to do
 and whatever it was I gave him without question
 and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
 and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door
 and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India
 and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January
 and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 
 and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all
 and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand
 and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there
 and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out
 and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room
 and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state
 and whether he derives this from his smiling father
 and which a singular chance has placed in our hands
 and which are worth considering
 and which he anoints with lime-cream
 and which he told inimitably
 and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter
 and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate
 and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you
 and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
 and who had already made a disturbance at Mr
 and who have retained Lestrade
 and who may have heard uncle
 and who they are
 and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St
 and whose residence is near Horsham
 and why I urged young Openshaw to caution
 and why I was so pale
 and why does he pursue this unhappy family
 and why should I go armed
 and why should he possess so much influence over her
 and why should not mine be
 and will
 and will be away all the evening
 and with a quill-pen
 and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
 and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
 and with her beautiful hair cut off
 and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard
 and with reason

 and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
 and with the steady

 and would have your opinion

 and written a little monograph on the ashes of

 and yet
 and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness
 and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes
 and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened
 and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed
 and yet I know it well
 and yet I question whether Mr
 and yet Mr
 and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants
 and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts
 and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him
 and yet every link rings true
 and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen
 and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever
 and yet her hair had already begun to whiten
 and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
 and yet his hard
 and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
 and yet the result is
 and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air
 and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself
 and yet was upon the left side
 and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart
 and you are always so interested in Mr
 and you are impressed by their beauty
 and you can have the keeping of us
 and you can read for yourself
 and you had your chance
 and you have a quick eye for colour
 and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him
 and you in that chair
 and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied
 and you make him a gaol-bird for life
 and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague
 and you renewed your acquaintance
 and you will contradict me if I go wrong
 and you will know all that there is to know
 and your relations to her
 and your secret
 and your son
 and--and--well

 answered the assistant promptly

 answering the look rather than the words
 anxious look upon her face

 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
 as Holmes had foretold
 as Holmes had remarked
 as I always was
 as I am sure your good sense would suggest
 as I ascended the stair
 as I call them
 as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes
 as I expected
 as I followed after him
 as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it
 as I had left it
 as I have already explained
 as I have already remarked to you
 as I have already said
 as I have done before now
 as I have often thought
 as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present
 as I have told you
 as I hoped
 as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
 as I knew well
 as I lay awake
 as I ran
 as I remarked before
 as I said then
 as I said yesterday
 as I should suspect
 as I told you she would
 as I understand
 as I used to say to mother
 as I will still call her
 as Spaulding said
 as a good seaman should be
 as a matter of fact
 as a rule
 as a second thought
 as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom
 as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret
 as cunning and as resolute as themselves
 as did the bushy whiskers
 as directed
 as ever
 as far as I can understand
 as far as I have been able to understand it
 as far as I know
 as far as he knew
 as far as it goes
 as far as the child is concerned
 as far as we could see
 as far as we have been able to ascertain
 as far as you could see
 as fresh and trim as possible
 as had been there when I arrived
 as he could go no farther
 as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three
 as he had done to a hundred before her
 as he had stated in his evidence
 as he has done from your life
 as he remarks
 as he said
 as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat
 as he threw himself down into his chair once more
 as he turned his face half round to the company once more
 as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar
 as he was only a few years older than me
 as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done
 as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
 as if a mass of metal had fallen
 as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow
 as if on some commission
 as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight
 as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him
 as if uncertain which to address
 as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure
 as is all that district
 as it afterwards transpired
 as it appears
 as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket
 as it happens
 as it has been for better men before you
 as it might be discovered
 as it seemed
 as it seemed to her
 as it seemed to me
 as it seemed to me at the time
 as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
 as it was a national possession
 as it was possible to conceive
 as it were
 as it would give them two days for their escape
 as large as a calf
 as matters stand
 as may be remembered
 as my companion rose to greet her
 as narratives
 as none knew better than myself
 as of burned paper
 as of old
 as of the swimmer who leaves the bank
 as one who finds himself in a perplexing position
 as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe
 as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess
 as resembling her in height
 as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself
 as she thought
 as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday
 as silent as Mrs
 as so many more have done
 as swift as intuitions
 as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
 as the inspector had said
 as the jury stated
 as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
 as they were frequently together
 as this matter is of paramount importance
 as this was
 as though his question was already answered
 as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
 as though it were new raised from a basin
 as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
 as though to remember every feature
 as to how it came here
 as to money
 as to sitting here or there
 as to the disappearance of the bride
 as to the personality of the criminal
 as was his custom when in judicial moods
 as was his habit when in high spirits
 as was his wont
 as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks
 as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice 
 as we may need to be at our best in the morning
 as we paced to and fro in front of the house
 as we were a partie carree
 as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father
 as when you find a trout in the milk
 as you are not connected with the official police
 as you can most readily imagine
 as you know
 as you may both think
 as you may have noticed
 as you may have remarked
 as you may see for yourselves

 as you remember

 but there was no answering smile in Holmes
 but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me
 but there was no sign of his return

 but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do
 but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink
 but you do not observe
 but you have hit upon the method
 but you have the advantage of me
 but you know what women are
 but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done
 but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing
 but you understand that as long as I live at home I don
 but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used
 but you will observe
 but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man

 during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
 during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street
 during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire
 during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
 during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire
 dusty and cheerless
 each in its own fields
 each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
 each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them

 following the guidance of Mr

 for Dr
 for God
 for I am a man who takes very little exercise
 for I am a widower and never had any family
 for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
 for I began as a ship
 for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room
 for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
 for I feared to change my position
 for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud
 for I had raised my voice in my anger
 for I have a business already
 for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free
 for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature
 for I have not much time
 for I have only been here a few hours
 for I have only half an hour
 for I have promised Mr
 for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr
 for I have used it before now for my own purposes
 for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial
 for I knew one or two things about him
 for I know that I am right
 for I observe that you are shivering
 for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal
 for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
 for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public
 for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all
 for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet
 for I very much prefer having a witness
 for I was myself regular in my habits
 for I was newly come back from a weary day
 for I was not sure when he might come
 for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend
 for I was weary after my night of adventure
 for I will be visible to you
 for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation
 for I would have told you that your pains were wasted

 for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town

 for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity
 for a sharp frost had set in

 for all I care
 for all I knew
 for all that
 for all that it was a cold night
 for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so
 for dad is very ill
 for days on end
 for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory
 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den
 for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it
 for example
 for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair
 for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman
 for goodness
 for having read De Quincey
 for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief
 for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
 for he had a single room
 for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked
 for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North
 for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
 for he had started to England just before it arrived
 for he has frequently brought him to my house
 for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up
 for he is a man of immense strength
 for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by
 for he is only five years and two months older than myself
 for he loves her devotedly
 for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track
 for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still
 for he said that he hated to be conspicuous
 for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me
 for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police
 for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket
 for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to
 for he was a very obstinate man
 for he was running hard
 for he was very superior
 for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist
 for here
 for his bills were all paid in ready money
 for his eye was bright
 for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould
 for his hand was still raised to it as he entered
 for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room
 for his son was away
 for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
 for if you will do what I have told you
 for instance
 for it
 for it cost them two and thirty pounds
 for it is a large square block of a house
 for it is a very extraordinary one
 for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home
 for it was considerably after midnight
 for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
 for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches
 for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced
 for it was that of none other than--well
 for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me
 for it would be absu
 for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened
 for my father was a man of a very violent temper
 for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant
 for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke
 for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right
 for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in
 for people in their position
 for pity
 for she had been away five years at a boarding-school
 for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
 for she has been much attracted by my description of you
 for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
 for she would have her way
 for solution during the years of our intimacy
 for something more solid
 for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night
 for that is his name
 for that is provided for
 for the Friday
 for the barmaid
 for the bigger the crime the more obvious
 for the business has not been over good for some years
 for the cabs go slowly through this snow
 for the country is more deserted there
 for the days of the great cases are past
 for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services
 for the first time
 for the goodwill and interest
 for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family
 for the moon had sunk
 for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell
 for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings
 for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate
 for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product
 for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance
 for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape
 for the table had not been cleared yet
 for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
 for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain
 for the woman had run back swiftly to the door
 for their purpose
 for there are no beryls in the world to match these
 for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door
 for there is a decided draught
 for there lies your only hope of safety
 for there was no sign of the stone
 for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands
 for they were always so exceedingly definite
 for this is one of my clients
 for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
 for this was the third demand during the month
 for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice
 for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o
 for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
 for we are dealing with a very cunning man
 for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint
 for we lurched and jolted terribly
 for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
 for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring
 for what right had he to prevent
 for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you
 for within an hour there arrived a confectioner
 for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies
 for you have had a long day
 for you will perhaps be able to post me up
 forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements
 found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross
 found ourselves in the office
 found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England
 founded upon all that I have heard of you

 from jealousy or some other motive
 from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon
 from some foolish freak when he was at college
 from the absolute stillness
 from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
 from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
 from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know
 from the rate that we seemed to go
 from the time that her father married again
 from what I gather
 from what you say
 from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
 from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given
 from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool
 fully dressed
 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest

 gaunt woman entered the room
 gave an inarticulate cry
 gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner
 gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
 gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate
 gave it a stricken look

 glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab
 glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger
 glancing at the message
 glancing at the postmark
 glancing at them occasionally
 glancing from one to the other of us

 glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
 glancing out of the window

 had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
 had been concerned in some such matter before
 had escaped
 had grown up
 had his ordinary clothes on
 had hurried up the steps
 had left only the day before
 had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it
 had no luck with my claim
 had sat down to breakfast with the rest
 had struggled with him
 had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife

 handsome
 hanging gold earrings
 hanging lip
 hard and much the worse for wear
 hardly be in the best of training
 hardly knowing what to say or do
 has actually been arrested
 has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases
 has come away from home with odd boots
 has deserted me
 has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage
 has got out of order
 has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days
 has lost all enterprise and originality
 has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran
 has only been in my service a few months
 has referred the case to me
 has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
 has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip
 have I
 have already gained publicity through the papers
 have baffled his analytical skill
 have been enough to shake my very soul
 have been written on Monday and only posted to-day
 have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter
 have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves
 have mercy
 have no compunction about shooting them down
 have you not
 have you not heard
 have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady
 have you solved it
 having a black top-hat
 having apparently given up his search
 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday
 having charming manners
 having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair
 having lit it
 having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue
 having put up our trap at a wayside public-house
 having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France
 having regard to his known eccentricity
 having served my time
 having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely
 having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times

 he added
 he answered
 he answered with a sidelong glance
 he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
 he appears as Mr
 he asked
 he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed
 he asked in a quavering voice
 he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
 he asked with his eyes open
 he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
 he beat his native butler to death and narrow
 he begged me to read aloud to him
 he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow
 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex
 he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
 he continued
 he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other
 he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
 he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him
 he could use her money
 he cried
 he cried impatiently
 he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming
 he denied everything
 he did
 he did not come in at all
 he driving back to the Temple
 he established a large practice
 he exclaimed at last
 he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street
 he found it
 he found that Horner had disappeared
 he gasped
 he gave a cry and dropped to the ground
 he gives no trouble
 he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
 he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects
 he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
 he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
 he had no means of supporting himself
 he had not
 he had on neither collar nor necktie
 he had pursued the thief
 he has always answered me like that
 he has been more nearly correct than the official force
 he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink
 he has his faults
 he has little to do with my story
 he hurried from the room
 he is sure to keep an eye on the papers
 he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round
 he is too terribly frightened
 he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever
 he laid it out upon the table
 he leaned back in his chair
 he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him
 he married the daughter of a local brewer
 he might have communicated with the outside air
 he might still flatter himself that he was safe
 he murmured
 he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet
 he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet
 he observed
 he ordered me to cease and to change my dress
 he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
 he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly
 he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual
 he remarked
 he remarked after a pause
 he remarked as he sat down
 he remarked as we emerged
 he remarked at last
 he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it
 he roared
 he rushed into the glade
 he said
 he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided
 he said at last
 he said cordially
 he said gravely
 he said when the cloth was cleared 
 he set off in my company for his chambers
 he shouted
 he shrieked
 he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path
 he snarled
 he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business
 he stammered
 he started
 he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter
 he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes
 he stumbled slowly from the room
 he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man
 he told me
 he took a fancy to me
 he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground
 he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall
 he w
 he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
 he was a perfect sample of the class
 he was averse to it also
 he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife
 he was convinced from your laughter
 he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband
 he was never so truly formidable as when
 he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross
 he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
 he was very good about it
 he waved me to an armchair
 he went off to France upon the business of the firm
 he whispered
 he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words
 he will be silent
 he will have a regular prison bath
 he would rush tumultuously in at the door and 
 he yelled
 heads thrown back
 heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
 heard a low
 heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
 heavily barred
 heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature
 heh
 heiress to the estate
 helpless worms
 her body slightly bent
 her eyes glancing back
 her face all drawn and grey
 her face blanched with terror
 her father brought her over for this last London season
 her father followed her
 her hands groping 
 her head and face protruded
 her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most
 her lips parted
 her room was empty
 her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard
 here
 here is Lestrade
 here is her carriage at the door
 here it is
 here on this page are the country folk
 hereditary kings of Bohemia
 hesitating fashion at our windows
 high-nosed and pale
 his arms folded
 his attitude and manner told their own story
 his baggy trousers
 his bare ankles protruding beneath
 his brow was all crinkled with anger
 his eyes fixed 
 his eyes twinkled
 his eyes were protruding
 his father
 his friend
 his hands in his pockets
 his hat
 his hat pulled down over his eyes
 his house being the nearest
 his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him
 his keys in his hand
 his legs stretched out in front of him
 his lips compressed
 his lodger
 his manner
 his red cravat
 his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects
 his shiny
 his shoulders bowed
 his skin the colour of putty
 his socks
 his step brisk
 his sympathetic smile
 his tall
 his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed
 his white tie
 his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday
 his wrinkles were gone
 holding it out
 holding my breath to keep out the vile
 holding the coronet in his hands
 holding up a little slip of paper in the air
 homely as it looks
 homeward bound to Savannah
 hoofs
 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb
 hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
 hot-blooded and reckless
 houses
 hover over this great city
 how are you
 how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man
 how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures
 how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be
 how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data
 how did you deduce that this man was intellectual
 how do you know
 how is she to prove their authenticity

 in the midst of my laughter
 in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow
 in the name of good-fortune

 it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door
 it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
 it did
 it did not go for very much
 it drives me half-mad to think of it
 it goes to my very heart
 it has already a sinister history
 it has been a long time in the acting
 it is
 it is a fact
 it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to
 it is a likely ruse enough
 it is a little awkward
 it is a matter of no importance
 it is a pity you didn
 it is a possible supposition
 it is a serious case
 it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight
 it is a useless expense
 it is after nine now
 it is all right
 it is all we can do to make him wash his hands
 it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play
 it is always under the honourable title of the woman
 it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself
 it is certain
 it is childish
 it is clear that she is not personally threatened
 it is conjectured to be so
 it is correct
 it is for the best
 it is his very own writing
 it is important also
 it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not
 it is in the house
 it is just as I have been telling you
 it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening
 it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge
 it is no doubt a pity
 it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry
 it is not I alone
 it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
 it is not even attached to a wire
 it is not for me to judge you
 it is not selfishness or conceit
 it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly
 it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress
 it is of no great consequence
 it is of some little use
 it is so dreadfully still in there
 it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other
 it is the most probable one
 it is the season of forgiveness
 it is too late--forever too late
 it is true
 it is very ingenious
 it made me mad
 it may prove to be something of interest
 it might be a husband
 it might be worth while to call Holmes
 it must be confessed
 it must be so
 it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely
 it said
 it says
 it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property
 it seemed safer to wait
 it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once
 it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there
 it seems
 it seems rather useless
 it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools
 it shall never be seen by mortal eye
 it sounds quite hollow
 it struck me as being a little out of the common
 it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father
 it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me
 it was at least a most suspicious remark
 it was careful to the verge of foppishness
 it was concerned with an opal tiara
 it was cracked
 it was easy to get corroboration
 it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
 it was gone
 it was less likely
 it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate
 it was most probable that the silent Englishman
 it was obvious
 it was obvious from the first
 it was obvious that he had passed after the other
 it was obvious to me that he had some stron
 it was only put there a couple of years ago
 it was quite beyond my powers to determine
 it was quite impossible to effect a rescue
 it was remarkably animated
 it was the beginning of 
 it was the children
 it was there
 it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value
 it was too late to alter the matter now
 it was twisted
 it will be taken up by quite a number of people
 it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands
 it won
 it would be as well
 it would be difficult to suggest a better
 it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans
 it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
 it would certainly be you
 it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so
 it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
 it would soon rouse inquiry
 it would take me all my time to break it
 its black muzzle buried in Rucastle
 its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes
 its silence broken only by the heavy
 jealousy is a strange transformer of characters

 sandwiched it between two rounds of bread

 saturated with the news of the day
 save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles
 save only one
 save some twisted cylinders and iron piping
 save that he quotes Balzac once
 save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red
 save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
 save with a gibe and a sneer
 saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice
 saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound
 saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend

 seedy coat
 seeing my look of incredulity
 seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
 seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately
 seeing that I smiled and shook my head
 seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions
 seeing that there were two of us
 seeing what I gained through one of them
 seems to have been a shock to her also

 she answered
 she answered me abruptly
 she asked
 she began
 she cried
 she cried breathlessly
 she cried in English
 she did not
 she does not love your Majesty
 she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart
 she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders
 she gave a violent start and looked up
 she had a slate-coloured
 she had no one to advise her at such a crisis
 she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
 she has turned all the men
 she hurried across the road
 she is incorrigible
 she is not so very young
 she may have been con
 she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken
 she ran forward
 she read the whole story and
 she repeated
 she replaced it
 she retorted upon me
 she rose hurriedly
 she rushed down the lane and
 she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor
 she said
 she said as she left him
 she said earnestly
 she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
 she seems
 she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it
 she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry
 she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward
 she was
 she was in her night-dress
 she was sure of it
 she went on
 she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
 she whispered
 she would not be allowed to remain single long
 she would not listen to another man

 shining hat
 shocked at having broken the window

 should still talk of marrying his son to Turner
 should you have any other engagement at that time

 since
 since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind
 since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort
 since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
 since the marriage is a fait accompli
 since the name is different
 since the ruined coronet was national property
 since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea
 since you are interested in these little problems
 since you have chosen to insult me
 since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion

 sinking back in deep thought

 sit down
 sitting beside him
 sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise
 sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee
 sitting down in my library-chair
 sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead
 sitting up in his bed
 sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one
 slammed the little door
 slate-roofed

 so I congratulate you again
 so I deduced a blunt pen-knife
 so I dressed
 so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me
 so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work
 so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn
 so I offered to typewrite them
 so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run
 so I retired to my room
 so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
 so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone
 so I think
 so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
 so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it
 so I trust that you may be in safety
 so I went first to have my wound dressed
 so I wrote to father at Bordeaux
 so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained

 so as to be there in time for your coming
 so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you
 so as to remove them without revealing what they are

 so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings
 so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
 so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
 so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy
 so long had he stood there
 so moist was the ground
 so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation
 so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house
 so so
 so sudden and so terrible is it
 so that
 so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back
 so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch
 so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
 so that I found myself without a situation
 so that I had an admirable opportunity
 so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died
 so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession
 so that I must look after the child
 so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead
 so that I should not be traced
 so that I thought little of what he said
 so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house
 so that even here in the heart of great
 so that he is always as keen as mustard
 so that he might have a private word with us
 so that he was left in possession of the field of battle
 so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster
 so that his lateness caused me no surprise
 so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise
 so that it flew upon the first person it saw
 so that it might never be really out of my reach
 so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met
 so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information
 so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages
 so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
 so that the jury

 so that the trustees are at their wits
 so that there is really no tie between them
 so that there were fewer passengers than usual
 so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe
 so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
 so that we shall have a clear field
 so that whether she married or not
 so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones
 so the place might not be so secluded

 so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats
 so we just fixed it all up for ourselves

 somehow I can get nothing to go upon
 someone had brought the gems
 something just a little funny about it

 somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures

 thank goodness
 thanks to this lucky chance
 that
 that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you
 that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
 that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man
 that I could think of nothing except of my father
 that I did manual labour
 that I have caught him
 that I may have something better before very many minutes are over
 that I must leave you to your papers for a little
 that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend
 that I should call you and give you the chance
 that I was a red-headed man
 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing
 that I would not risk the loss of it
 that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
 that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use
 that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work
 that be the house of Dr
 that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
 that can touch the scoundrel
 that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
 that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman
 that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself
 that for ten years to come
 that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me
 that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him
 that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum
 that he has been in China
 that he is a Freemason
 that he is middle-aged
 that he might have been trying to straighten it
 that he might settle his debts of honour
 that he takes snuff
 that he uttered it before he saw you
 that he was a widower
 that he was looking at me with great intensity
 that his hair is grizzled
 that if both girls had married
 that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him
 that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast
 that in every case there is some little slurring over of the

 that is all
 that is clear enough
 that is it
 that is only just for the time
 that is suggestive

 that is undoubtedly my hat
 that it has been recently cut
 that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house
 that it must have been nearer twelve
 that it was not
 that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
 that it would be at St
 that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete
 that maiden
 that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager
 that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime
 that my hair is of a very full and rich tint
 that my own shadow might not fall upon the page
 that my poor father met his end
 that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
 that my wife was standing in the street
 that need cause you no inconvenience
 that night with a very grave face
 that of Hatherley
 that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited
 that settles the question
 that she does not carry it about with her
 that she had become suddenly deranged
 that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed
 that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr
 that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
 that something had happened
 that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation
 that the bureau had been forced open
 that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man
 that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort
 that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise
 that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well
 that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public
 that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
 that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of
 that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case
 that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity
 that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you
 that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden
 that they had completed their tunnel
 that they were all three away from the ship last night
 that to me
 that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope
 that was all I knew
 that was not the point
 that was unfortunate
 that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up
 that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
 that we had better go in without you
 that we just did it right there
 that we may let some light into this dark place
 that we may prove it
 that we shall be able to strike deeper still
 that we were in the country
 that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
 that whatever happened I would always be true to him
 that whatever her sins are
 that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished
 that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear
 that would not be offensive to you
 that you are nearing the end of your troubles
 that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences
 that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe
 that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart
 that you have already made up your mind
 that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you
 that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up
 that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life

 there were several little changes carried out about that time
 there were two barred-tailed ones
 thereby hangs a rather painful tale
 therefore
 they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday
 they come again--of course that was for the cloak
 they go
 they had each tugged at the coronet
 they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
 they have shown extraordinary energy
 they made their way to the room in which Mr
 they may do us some harm unless we are careful
 they separated
 they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity
 they were compelled to open the window
 they were peculiar boots
 they were really odd ones
 they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
 thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke
 thickening into a grove at the highest point

 thin breathing of our new companion
 thin fingers in time to the music
 thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
 thin legs towards the fire

 this is a time for observation
 this is the right side
 this is too serious for dawdling
 this may save us a visit to Brixton Road
 this relentless persecution
 this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime

 though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society
 though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done
 though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face
 though I see you have got his coat-tails
 though I should not venture to say that the danger is over
 though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now
 though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight
 though I was not aware in which direction he was going

 though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess
 though how he found us is more than I can think
 though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas
 though it sounds funny
 though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded

 though the future only could show how strange it was to be

 threw her arms about my wife
 threw it across to me
 threw it into the iron safe
 threw up her hands with a despairing gesture
 threw up my arms to cover my face
 thrilling with horror
 through the door
 through the fall in agricultural prices
 through the window of which the moon was shining brightly
 through which streamed the light of a lantern
 throughout three continents
 throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe
 throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade
 throwing his cigarette into the fire
 throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion

 to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night
 to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass
 to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding
 to cause her to change her mind
 to come to an end of the matter
 to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face
 to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match
 to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
 to get clear upon the subject
 to get near the window
 to hear the fuss that is made over them
 to its highest pitch
 to listen to her story
 to make me even less so than usual
 to make up for the way in which I had earned it
 to me as a doctor
 to me it seems exceedingly complex
 to my astonishment
 to my brother
 to my horror
 to my horror and astonishment
 to my relief
 to my surprise
 to my surprise and delight
 to my very great astonishment
 to my wife as an old friend and school companion
 to obey any little commands my wife might give
 to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it
 to prove that it had been wound up two hours before
 to quote Thoreau
 to raise his hand as if to strike him
 to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance
 to reason from what you see
 to resolve all our doubts
 to return to him when summoned
 to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested
 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A

 to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe

 to show him that I was alive
 to show me that I was not mistaken

 to the police-station
 to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland
 to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind
 to this ventilator
 to turn my face away from the window

 to watch you

 to work out the case in his interest
 to your dressing-room

 together with many minor ones
 told him that all was right
 told me how narrow had been my escape
 told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him

 took a house in the country
 took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it
 took out your coronet
 took to drink

 turning his head from left to right
 turning it over
 turning over the leaves and dried sticks
 turning to me
 turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap

 unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight
 until at last I gave it over in despair
 until at last he asked a thing which I could not give
 until at last he became the terror of the village
 until at last he smoothed one out
 until at last my heart began to sink
 until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance
 until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw
 until my uncle here began to speak loudly
 until one knee rested upon the edge
 until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter
 until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose
 until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals
 until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge
 until we were past Reading
 until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story
 upon a corner house
 upon my approaching it
 upon terms of perfect equality
 upon the left-hand side
 upon the night of May 
 upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details

 we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come
 we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors
 we could easily give you a shake-down
 we don
 we drove through two scattered villages
 we drove to our hotel
 we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind
 we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police
 we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years
 we hope
 we may call it conclusive
 we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr
 we may drive back to our luncheon
 we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America
 we must be prompt
 we must choose our positions
 we must leave you for if Dr
 we must make the best use of our time
 we must put the screen over that dark lantern
 we must try the simplest means first
 we need certainly to muster all our resources
 we never know where to find the man himself
 we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door
 we presume
 we reached the lawn
 we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo
 we shall not need you
 we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
 we shall order breakfast
 we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
 we shall see who agrees with you
 we shall see who will win in the long run
 we shall soon clear up all that
 we shall take you away to your aunt

 were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
 were printed upon the white wrist
 were scrawled upon one side
 were sufficient to absorb all my attention
 were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step
 were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
 were the main points of my analysis
 were twins
 were within that radius
 what
 what I feel sure is the truth
 what I should do
 what a blind fool I have been
 what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
 what a woman
 what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father
 what an observant young lady we have come upon
 what clue could you have as to his identity
 what could have happened
 what did you gather from that woman
 what did you think
 what do the public
 what do you make of that
 what do you mean
 what do you think would happen if I did break it
 what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office

 what happened to him when there
 what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church
 what is it
 what is this extraordinary mystery
 what is your own impression as to the young lady
 what o
 what occurred in your house last night
 what on earth does this mean
 what shall I do
 what use was my hair to me
 what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night
 whatever happened
 whatever remains
 when
 when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
 when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual
 when I came to look round me
 when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished
 when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me
 when I flash a light upon them
 when I found how I had betrayed myself
 when I give you these results
 when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard
 when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer
 when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
 when I have no news of her husband
 when I heard a hideous outcry behind me
 when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches
 when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in
 when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning
 when all father
 when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping
 when he became a specialist in crime
 when he died
 when he entered
 when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind
 when he had left
 when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings
 when he shook himself
 when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
 when he was only a lad
 when his blow fell
 when it was crushed in the press
 when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink
 when last seen
 when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart
 when my father came to live at Horsham
 when my way led me through Baker Street
 when nothing else would do
 when once his case has been settled
 when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others
 when pursued by so formidable an antagonist
 when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room
 when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them
 when she married again so soon after father
 when taken with the decline of his fortunes
 when the door flew open
 when the fit was on him
 when the maid
 when the maid brought in a telegram
 when the row broke out
 when there were signs that
 when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr
 when they come
 when they could have their pick for 
 when they talked of marrying within the week
 when we had all three read this epistle
 when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
 when we went to search for him
 when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street
 when you address me always to say 
 when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us
 when you had
 when you see that a young lady
 when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning
 when your stepfather comes back
 whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath
 whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
 whence it will
 whenever he saw you
 where
 where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting
 where I believe that she has met with considerable success
 where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town
 where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
 where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel
 where I received an excellent education
 where I was soon asleep
 where Pa was working a claim
 where a corner holding three gems had been torn away
 where a few drops of blood had fallen
 where a few lights still glimmered in the windows
 where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
 where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony
 where all traces were lost
 where breakfast had been prepared
 where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
 where he can get it if he wants it
 where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight
 where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary
 where he lived
 where he remained for three or four years
 where he rose to be a colonel
 where he was reported to have done very well
 where is he now
 where more stress is laid
 where she fattened fowls for the market
 where she found matters as described by the last witness
 where she sat for some time
 where strangers could hardly wander
 where the company has its French offices
 where the lady is walking
 where the security is unimpeachable
 where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle
 where the typewritist presses against the table
 where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed
 where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station
 where we found lunch upon the table
 where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes
 where you found me to-night

 whether you be alive or dead

 which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
 which I shall expect the bank to refund
 which I took to be the police
 which I was eager enough to do
 which I will read to you
 which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders
 which appeared not to be inhabited at all
 which appeared to be a mere whim at first
 which are
 which are next to each other in one corner of the building
 which are sent over to him by a correspondent
 which are the duplicates of Mr
 which at the time of the wife
 which boomed out every quarter of an hour
 which both hinted at a disguise
 which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane
 which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward
 which can only mean that he was not familiar with it
 which caused me to run back again
 which chanced to be in the market
 which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights
 which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door
 which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta
 which ended in a very massive iron gate
 which felt about in the centre of the little area of light
 which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance
 which had been always locked up
 which had been cut near the nail
 which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage
 which happened to be the only other cab in the street
 which has dried itself
 which he closed upon it
 which he consulted
 which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling
 which he had apparently adjusted that very moment
 which he opened for us
 which he unlocked
 which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City
 which interests me deeply
 which is
 which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
 which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across
 which is a most useful material for showing traces
 which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect
 which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley
 which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn
 which is a very large room
 which is about half a mile from the house
 which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh
 which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination
 which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water
 which is in itself a monotonous occupation
 which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage
 which is just before pay-day
 which is mature for marriage
 which is opposite
 which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French
 which is rather vague
 which is the German for 
 which it took all his strength of mind to control
 which lay at the foot of the garden
 which lay to his credit at the bank
 which lay uncovered as the tide receded
 which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door
 which looked keenly about it
 which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves
 which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work
 which makes one for you
 which may have any bearing upon the case
 which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to
 which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place
 which might seem trivial to another
 which mother carried on with Mr
 which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
 which must have belonged to the attic
 which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar
 which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
 which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator
 which pattered down upon his plate
 which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair
 which proved
 which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence
 which seemed the d
 which seemed to be bound tightly round his head
 which set an edge to a man
 which she closed and fastened as I approached
 which she describes as being terribly agitated
 which she held above her head
 which shone out like a star
 which should have the effect of callin
 which should settle the matter
 which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book
 which shows that blotting-paper has been used
 which struck me at once
 which terminated at another formidable gate
 which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
 which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt
 which told us a very plain tale
 which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty
 which turned at a right angle at the farther end
 which vanished immediately
 which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master
 which was a hundred yards or more down the lane
 which was a us
 which was all perfectly true
 which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before
 which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body
 which was increased by the two guardsmen
 which was invariably locked
 which was loose
 which was mottled all over with bloodstains
 which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
 which was performed at St
 which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
 which was the very room which I suspected
 which was throbbing painfully
 which was to him as a counsellor
 which was used by the poor girl
 which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings
 which wasn
 which were quite as prompt
 which were secured every night
 which widened gradually
 which will no doubt strike you
 which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
 which would

 while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and
 while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell
 while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner
 while I sat beside him
 while I sat opposite to him
 while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window
 while I take a glance as to who our client is
 while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
 while Wooden-leg had waited a little
 while a number of better dressed people

 while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
 while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent

 while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down
 while his gently smiling face and his languid
 while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter
 while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
 while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
 while others have been but partially cleared up
 while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing
 while she held a candle in her right
 while the brass box stood open and empty beside it
 while the clergyman beamed on me in front
 while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl

 while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely
 while the other was a long

 who appears to have had little of his own
 who asked him to step in
 who believe in his innocence
 who cares for me
 who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work
 who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb
 who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that
 who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party
 who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right
 who forgot all about it for some days
 who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat
 who had been sitting in the window
 who had brought in the coffee
 who had charge of the case
 who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption
 who had known him in California
 who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold

 who had rushed up with the same intention
 who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings
 who had stepped from her carriage

 who is an accountant living on the ground floor
 who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill
 who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases
 who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate
 who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England
 who is to be our companion in to-night
 who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting
 who knew his every mood and habit
 who knew how he winced from the very thought of death
 who lives near Harrow
 who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
 who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country
 who may remain in the house with me
 who might give the alarm
 who probably know so much of Rucastle
 who seemed to be expostulating with them
 who seemed to be looking in my direction
 who soon pushed her out again
 who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks
 who struggled frantically
 who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
 who thrust her back and
 who took sides with one of the loungers
 who used to be our foreman
 who was a member of your goose club
 who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game
 who was also an ex-Australian
 who was as amiable as ever
 who was by all accounts a very hard man
 who was equally hot upon the other side
 who was introduced to me as Mr
 who was said to have gone to America
 who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet
 who was this very man McCarthy
 who was very peculiar in his ways
 who was waiting outside
 who went to the bad
 who were playing for thousands
 who would ask for all that the law would give him
 whoa
 whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease
 whom I have known for many years
 whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
 whom you helped in the hour of her sore need
 whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet
 whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities
 whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead
 whose name has not been ascertained
 whose name is not mentioned
 whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg
 why did he not invent a lie
 why did he not say so
 why did you not come at once
 why does he not explain them
 why should I put ideas in his head
 why should he remain away from you
 why should she come at all
 why should you come to consult me
 why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place
 wild and free
 wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more
 will answer your purpose equally well
 will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine
 will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid

 wish to follow it from the outset
 wished you good-night

 with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
 with a black veil
 with a bland
 with a bright
 with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
 with a clergyman all ready in waiting
 with a cold
 with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
 with a cry
 with a face that a man might die for
 with a feather of a brickish red
 with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
 with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
 with a garden at the back
 with a gesture of desperation
 with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
 with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
 with a grey carpet
 with a hand on either side of the aperture
 with a head which is quite disproportionately large
 with a heart which was full of forebodings
 with a heavy stick in his hand
 with a high
 with a high central portion and two curving wings
 with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to
 with a huge ledger upon the table
 with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand
 with a kind of question in his eyes
 with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
 with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
 with a long
 with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace
 with a massive
 with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
 with a pleasant
 with a plunge
 with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned
 with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage
 with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
 with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers
 with a round table in the centre
 with a scream

 with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters
 with a shattered skull
 with a slight tremor of his extended hand

 with a start
 with a strong
 with a strong nature
 with a sudden effort
 with a thick
 with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
 with a very injured expression upon his face
 with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat
 with a week
 with a woman
 with all its advantages and all its disadvantages
 with all this
 with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
 with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
 with black beads sewn upon it
 with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots
 with brownish speckles
 with confederates
 with corridors
 with dark hair and eyes
 with dismantled shelves and open drawers
 with eager eyes and parted lips
 with every confidence
 with every nerve in a twitter
 with expectancies fo
 with fear and astonishment upon her broad
 with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
 with grizzled hair and whiskers
 with hanging jowl
 with her eyes fixed full upon me
 with her hands wrung together
 with here and there a dark
 with high autumnal winds
 with high collar
 with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire
 with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat
 with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
 with his face buried in his hands
 with his finger-tips together
 with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling
 with his forefinger upon the paper
 with his head cocked and his arms akimbo
 with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
 with his head sunk upon his breast
 with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
 with his head terribly injured
 with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee
 with his jaw resting upon his two fists
 with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together
 with his long
 with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
 with immense capacity for self-restraint
 with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour
 with intervals of note-taking and of meditation
 with its back turned towards it
 with its writhing fingers
 with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge
 with knitted brows and an abstracted air
 with long windows almost to the floor
 with me
 with my hands on the Testament
 with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
 with news as to the box and the papers
 with no actual ill-treatment from Mr
 with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address
 with occasional little springs
 with restless frightened eyes
 with something of a German accent
 with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing
 with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
 with such skill that nobody can find them
 with the blood running freely down his face
 with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys
 with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed
 with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
 with the cocked pistol in my hand
 with the collar turned up
 with the control of my own income
 with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
 with the deepest interest
 with the door locked upon the inside
 with the exception of his coat
 with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head
 with the initials of K
 with the intention of awaiting him
 with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side
 with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season
 with the lantern and a magnifying lens
 with the letters 
 with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features
 with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
 with the name of 
 with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me
 with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid
 with the result that you have seen
 with the saddest look upon her face
 with the same result
 with the same trouble
 with the small 
 with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him
 with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun
 with this thought in my mind
 with this very paper in his hand
 with three long windows reaching down to the floor
 with three of the beryls in it
 with two small wicker-work chairs
 with two windows in the one and one in the other
 with what you earn into the bargain
 with whatever interest you think it right to charge
 with yellow
 with you
 with your assistance
 with your permission
 within a few feet of me
 without a care in the world
 without affectation
 without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness
 without any warning or sound
 without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
 without anything being found which could incriminate him
 without being interesting
 without either his gun or his hat
 without even giving me time to thank him
 without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character
 without flying away after theories and fancies
 without rest

 working through generations

 yes
 yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
 yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be
 yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone
 yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
 you
 you are
 you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre
 you are coming along wonderfully
 you are like a magician
 you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country
 you are perfectly correct
 you are the very man whom I have longed to meet
 you are unable to see how they are attained
 you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
 you can
 you can always draw him by a bet
 you can ask the King of Proosia
 you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears
 you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 
 you can see everything
 you could manage there for one night
 you dig fuller
 you find it so
 you forfeit your whole position forever
 you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune
 you have already met
 you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
 you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room
 you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves
 you have heard it all
 you have just come at the right time
 you have learned something
 you have not
 you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
 you have seen inside
 you have to be in the office
 you know
 you know father didn
 you know now
 you know the people who live under my roof
 you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof
 you know--faddy but kind-hearted
 you look on these things from another standpoint
 you made me reveal what you wanted to know
 you may be interested in this
 you may carry that feeling away with you
 you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
 you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
 you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van
 you might have your rubber after all
 you must at once put the box out upon the sundial
 you must have some wine and water
 you must not discourage me
 you must open the shutters of your window
 you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way
 you on one occasion
 you remark in this note of yours
 you rifled the jewel-case
 you scoundrel
 you see
 you thief
 you thought
 you understand
 you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
 you will allow
 you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day
 you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street
 you will observe
 you will recollect
 you would
 you would agree with me that he needed it
 you would facilitate matters immensely
 you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative
 you would just walk in
 you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter
 you would not object to our little whim
 your Majesty
 your client may rest in peace
 your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
 your father
 your friend
 your household
 your lad tugging at one side of the coronet
 your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next
 your rooms were unapproachable from that side
 your secret lies in London
 your son
 your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye
 your statement is singularly lucid
 your stepfather
 your very life may depend upon it
 yours had to be sacrificed also
 yourself
-- Oh
--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess
--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you
--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--
--I was returning from a journey to a patient 
--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion
--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address
--NEVILLE
--You really did it very well
--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel
--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason
--he gave a little stately cough--
--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--
--he sank his face into his thin
--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage

--there came to Lee a gentleman
--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--

A
A Case of Identity
A Juryman
A Scandal in Bohemia
A call for help
A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect
A client
A confidential servant
A considerable crime is in contemplation
A day which has saved England from a great public scandal
A diamond
A dozen yards or so
A fair dowry
A feeling of repulsion
A few moments later he was in our room
A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
A flush stole over Miss Sutherland
A greater distance to travel
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
A house on fire
A husband
A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
A likely story
A little French
A little too much so
A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
A marriage has been arranged
A most painful matter to me
A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
A pair
A patient
A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time
A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting
A slow and heavy step
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened
A thing like a cleaver
A thousand pounds
A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it

ARAT
About a month then
About nine o
About sixty
About the same
Absolute and complete silence before
Absolutely
Absolutely none
After all
Again Holmes raved in the air
Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland
Ah
Ah yes
Alas
Alice is her name
All day I was engaged in my professional work
All has turned out splendidly
All is lost
All right
Always
American slang is very expressive sometimes
Ample
An accident
An elderly man
An enemy
And
And Holmes
And I
And I am for north
And I feel dissatisfied
And I have some business to do which will take some hours
And I say east
And I to find an enemy
And I you
And Irene Adler
And Mademoiselle
And Miss Sutherland
And a very good thing
And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side
And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be
And be laughed at for my pains
And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr
And did you observe any change in her then
And for present expenses
And from a noble client
And has your business been attended to in your absence
And have you any on hand just now
And he is a man with a wooden leg
And he is admirably suited for it
And help
And how
And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night
And how did he make his money
And how did you find out
And how did you verify them
And how far from the edge of the wood
And how have you succeeded
And how in the world did you find them
And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink
And is that all
And it did
And it is--
And leave your case unfinished
And my duties
And my son
And no more words were needed
And not a word to a soul
And now
And now I have a very strange experience to tell you
And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study
And now a word as to my household
And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter
And now it is time that we arranged our little plans
And now there is only she to be described
And now you must on no account lose another instant
And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you
And on what day did he meet his death
And one who was at home in the district
And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill
And perhaps
And pray what am I charged with
And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
And she would need to be
And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year
And sit in the dark
And so do I
And that is--
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet
And the cigar-holder
And the lady
And the murderer
And the papers
And the pay
And the ring
And the work
And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth
And they were posted to-day at Gravesend
And this
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
And very wet it seems to have made you
And what are they worth
And what did you do then
And what did you learn from him
And what did you see
And what do you think of it all
And what else
And what of Irene Adler
And what salary do you ask
And what then
And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw
And when will you call
And where is it
And who could it be who was her confederate
And who is her maid
And who is this Captain Calhoun
And why
And why did you wish to see me
And why in hopes
And yet
And yet I am not convinced of it
And yet I question
And you are a benefactor of the race
And you are sure that this is your husband
And you can do nothing until then
And you did very wisely
And you don
And you may expect us early in the afternoon
And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious
And you thought he was pulled back
And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane
And your father
And your mother is alive
Anyhow
Anything else
Are they not fresh and beautiful
Are you
Arms
Arthur
Arthur does
As I dressed I glanced at my watch
As I entered
As I grew richer I grew more ambitious
As I waited
As a rule
As far as you are personally concerned
As governess
As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man
As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room
As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue
As he spoke there was a tap at the door
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses
As it happens
As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved
As low as you can
As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage
As to the letters
As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord
As you both locked your doors at night
At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station
At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead
At eight in the morning
At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
At half wages
At least
At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance
At the same time
At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect
At the wedding breakfast
At three o
At what time
Awake
Away they went
Away we went then

Be it so
Because during the last few nights I have always
Because he was handy and would come cheap
Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here
Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
Before the what
Besides
Better close the front door
Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook
Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour
Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross
Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment
Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon
Both you and the coroner have been at some pains
Bought
Breckinridge
Breckinridge is his name
Bring me the books
But
But Holmes shook his head gravely
But I am all in the dark
But I am so sure that he is innocent
But I am somewhat headstrong by nature
But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
But I have heard all that you have heard
But I have heard that the crocuses promise well
But I saw nothing
But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room
But I would not have let the young man come to harm
But Mr
But a cripple
But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
But a very serious one to me
But at any time
But have you
But have you told me all
But he
But he is right
But he might be a bachelor
But he must be alive
But his lameness
But his left-handedness
But his voice was just a little too coaxing
But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him
But how
But how about Mr
But how could you guess what the motive was
But how did you gain them
But how will you look
But if I am to go
But if he is innocent
But it has twice been burgled
But it is impossible
But it is profoundly true
But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again
But it might have been a cry of surprise
But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion
But not more so than I to find you
But of what society
But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go
But pray tell me
But she could not love him
But she will refuse
But the gems
But the inspector was mistaken
But the letter had also a greater distance to come
But the money
But the mystery
But the reason is very obvious
But the twelve-mile drive
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure
But they listened to my story with a smile
But this maid
But to whom
But was there another with a barred tail
But we can
But what
But what harm can there be in that
But what is it you wish
But what is that compared with the number of your successes
But what is the good of all these vague theories
But what other is there
But what will you do
But who is he
But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street
But with no very good result
But without his collar or tie
But you are joking
But you can know nothing of this
But you can understand
But you have hopes
But you have no notion as to what it could have been
But you have read the evidence
But you were on a friendly footing
But you would not advise me to refuse
But your client--
By Jove
By all means
By eleven o
By no means
By the same brilliant reasoning
By the select prices
By the way
By this time the whole house was astir
By train from Waterloo

HUNTER
Ha
Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium
Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane
Had there been women in the house
Half dazed
Hampshire
Has he come with you to-night
Have they thought of looking outside the house
Have you a couple of days to spare
Have you an order to see him in prison
Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain
Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings
Have you heard anything of the case
Have you her photograph
Have you it here
Have you managed it
Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
Have you never--
Have you the chisel and the bags
Having left Lestrade at his rooms
Having once spotted my man
He
He broke the seal and glanced over the contents
He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning
He can
He certainly needs a wash
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long
He didn
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman
He disappeared so suddenly
He doesn
He flicked the horse with his whip
He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat
He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life
He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street
He has
He has come back and done it
He has every requirement
He has his own little methods
He has written to me to say that he would be here at six
He held out his snuffbox of old gold
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
He investigated the case with great care
He is
He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp
He is a hard man
He is a man who leads a sedentary life
He is asleep
He is dead
He is looking up at the numbers of the houses
He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope
He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him
He is still with you
He knows it already
He looked inside the envelope
He looked surprised and
He looked very hard at me as I spoke
He might
He might have leaped back
He must guard himself
He often had a wild way of talking
He only
He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him
He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper
He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro
He said that you could solve anything
He said too much
He says four o
He seems a very amiable person
He shot one of his suspicious looks at me
He shrugged his shoulders
He slept on the premises
He snatched it from her in his eagerness
He stood
He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket
He took an orange from the cupboard
He travels for Westhouse 
He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand
He walked swiftly round from one to the other
He was a large man with rounded shoulders
He was a man of about fifty
He was a very shy man
He was in the house about half an hour
He went alone
Her banker or her lawyer
Her father is very rich
Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
Here
Here are the very letters
Here he is
Here is a very fashionable epistle
Here is an advertisement which will interest you
Here is my lens
Here is the first notice which I can find
Here is the foresight
Here is the slip and here are four letters from him
Here it is
Here we are
Here you are
His conduct was certainly not very gracious
His face fell immediately
His hand when he wrote hurriedly
His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
His manner was not effusive
His name is Vincent Spaulding
His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left
His smile broadened
His son
Hold up
Holmes
Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
Holmes chuckled heartily
Holmes grinned at the last item
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane
Holmes had sat up upon the couch
Holmes laughed
Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
Holmes moved the lamp
Holmes nodded his head
Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him
Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him
Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
Holmes shook his head gravely
Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
Holmes took a note of it
Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
Holmes turned to his desk and
Holmes turned to the page indicated
Holmes was for the moment as startled as I

How
How about poison
How are you getting on
How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
How can you tell that
How could I help suspecting him
How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments
How could they have decoyed him down there
How did he come
How did that help you
How did you deduce the select
How did you know
How did you trace it
How do you know
How do you know that
How far from the body
How is that
How is the glass
How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell
How long did she speak to this Alice
How many
How often
How on earth--
How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould
How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil
How very absurd
How would fifty guineas for a night
Hullo
Hum
I
I advertised for him in last Saturday
I am Dr
I am Mr
I am a dying man
I am a practical man
I am about to be married
I am afraid
I am afraid so
I am afraid that I am still a sceptic
I am afraid that it is quite essential
I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine
I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions
I am afraid that that is quite impossible
I am afraid that you will find it difficult
I am afraid the doctor won
I am all attention
I am an old campaigner
I am armed
I am ashamed of you
I am delighted to hear it
I am delighted to see you
I am endeavouring to tell you everything
I am following you closely
I am for west
I am glad of all details
I am glad to hear you say so
I am glad to hear your Majesty say so
I am going right on
I am immensely indebted to you
I am in hopes that she does
I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past
I am naturally observant
I am no official agent
I am not quite so bulky
I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies
I am saved
I am so delighted that you have come
I am so glad that you have come
I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty
I am sorry to knock you up so early
I am still in the dark
I am sure
I am sure if I had known--
I am sure that I do not know
I am sure that you are right
I am sure we owe you an apology
I am surprised that Lord St
I am the King
I am to be neutral
I am to remain neutral
I am very much afraid that it is not
I answered that I had not
I assure you
I assure you that I am in your hands
I assured him that I was not offended
I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me
I beg pardon
I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands
I beg that you will state your business
I begin to think
I believe
I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder
I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
I believe that he is coming here
I bowed
I brought this with me
I called about that beggarman
I came to find a friend
I came to you
I can
I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter
I can quite understand your thinking so
I can see nothing
I can serve you best by returning to my rooms
I cannot
I cannot admire his taste
I cannot as yet see any connection
I cannot imagine
I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records
I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted
I cannot say that I have
I cannot see that there is anything very funny
I cannot tell
I cannot think
I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk
I carefully examined the writing
I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so
I confess that I have been as blind as a mole
I confess that I still share my uncle
I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
I could do with much less than that
I could hardly believe my ears
I could hardly imagine a more damning case
I could not ask for anything better
I could not bear the disgrace
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction
I could not sleep that night
I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply
I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client
I could see that the end had not been in his mouth
I daresay that if I had put 
I did as I was told
I did as he ordered
I did at first
I did not gain very much
I did not know
I did not say a probable one
I did so
I didn
I do
I do not encourage visitors
I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you
I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain
I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried
I do not know what to think
I do not quite follow
I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
I do not think Flora would hurt a fly
I do not wish to make a mystery
I do so want a little help
I don
I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table
I fail to see that anyone is to blame
I fancy that my pal is all right
I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge
I fear not
I feared as much
I feel it give a little
I feel that time is of value
I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me
I find it hard enough to tackle facts
I fished about with a rake
I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks
I found her more interesting than her little problem
I fully share your opinion
I glanced at the books upon the table
I groaned
I guessed as much
I had
I had 
I had a friend once called Maudsley
I had an idea that he might
I had been away from home for three days at Bristol
I had been delayed at a case
I had better put my hat on
I had called upon my friend
I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas
I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room
I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative
I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected
I had gone up to town about an investment
I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend
I had hoped
I had just finished my tea when he returned
I had never seen my friend
I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird
I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations
I had seen little of Holmes lately
I hardly consider that a conclusive proof
I hardly think that likely
I have
I have a cab outside
I have a small pawnbroker
I have almost every link in my hands
I have already given you my word
I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
I have been a governess for five years
I have been at some small expense over this matter
I have been beaten four times--three times by men
I have been far too generous with you in money matters
I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money
I have been making a fool of myself
I have been too busy to think of food
I have been waiting so eagerly for you
I have come for advice
I have devised seven separate explanations
I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr
I have excellent ears
I have felt helpless
I have given you the chance
I have had diabetes for years
I have had nothing else to do
I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr
I have heard of you
I have heard so
I have hopes
I have just been there
I have made my dark room up there
I have my revolver
I have no data yet
I have no doubt of it
I have no doubt that I am very stupid
I have not yet done what I came for
I have notes of several similar cases
I have nothing to do to-day
I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town
I have ordered a carriage
I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night
I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron
I have seen the police
I have seen the will of the deceased wife
I have seen those symptoms before
I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
I have solved it
I have some remembrance
I have spent the whole day
I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
I have them in the hollow of my hand
I have very little difficulty in finding what I want
I hear that it was during the night
I held the little printed slip to the light
I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night
I hope we may clear him
I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran
I knew your energetic nature
I know
I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master
I know where it is
I know you
I left him then
I let you know
I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes
I make nothing of it
I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments
I met him first at the gasfitters
I must discuss it while I eat
I must go home now
I must really ask you to be a little more quiet
I never have
I never hope to see such a sight as that again
I nodded again
I nodded to show that I had heard
I noted
I only looked in as I passed
I only wish that you could come with me
I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand
I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close
I owe you an apology
I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address
I perceive that all is as it should be
I placed my revolver
I pray not
I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation
I promise
I quite follow you
I reached this one
I really don
I really have made no inquiries on the subject
I really wouldn
I regret that I have kept you waiting
I rose to go
I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
I saw her in conversation with her maid
I saw it in a paper
I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope
I say
I say a night
I say it is
I say now
I say that I have solved it
I searched the Dundee records
I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire
I see
I see it
I see many objections to any such theory
I see no marks
I see that you have had some great trouble
I see--her ladyship
I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
I shall be at Baker Street at ten
I shall be delighted
I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes
I shall certainly be there
I shall come down in a carriage to meet you
I shall drive out in the park at five as usual
I shall expect you
I shall glance into the case for you
I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now
I shall have this matter probed to the bottom
I shall jot down the facts
I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee
I shall most certainly do so
I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never
I shall never see them again
I shall not keep you waiting an instant
I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again
I shall see you at Horsham
I shall try not to miss anything of importance
I shook my head
I should be able to look after that for you
I should be better able to advise you
I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse
I should be happy to make myself useful
I should be immensely obliged to you
I should be ungrateful if I were not
I should be very glad now to go upstairs
I should certainly speak to the police
I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
I should like to see him very much
I should much prefer to have it so
I should not be surprised if that were he
I should not dream of trying
I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak
I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions
I should wish to
I signed the paper as directed
I slept at Baker Street that night
I smiled and shook my head
I sponged the wound
I started from home before six
I started off
I suppose
I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
I suppose that you could not possibly whistle
I suppose you know all about it
I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
I tell you that it is Friday
I thank you
I thank your Majesty
I then lounged down the street and found
I think
I think I could lay my finger on it
I think it very unlikely
I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime
I think that I had better go
I think that I have seen now all that there is to see
I think that I heard a ring
I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon
I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy
I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning
I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used
I think that it is very probable
I think that there you ask a little too much
I think that this should do
I think that this typewritten letter is from you
I think that we may safely say
I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear
I think you will find
I thought I
I thought as much
I thought at first that you had done something clever
I thought it as well
I thought of the fifty guineas
I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall
I thought that I was out of geese
I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help
I told you that I would call
I told you yesterday
I took a step forward
I took it up and examined it
I took it up and glanced at it
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
I took the lamp from him
I took the paper from him and read as follows
I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully
I trust that I am not intruding
I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours
I trust that we are not too late
I waited until midnight
I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers
I walked down to the station with them
I want to test a little theory of mine
I warn you that they are very incomplete
I was a little startled at the nature of the child
I was admiring your fuller
I was afraid that you were engaged
I was also aware of that
I was amused by her society
I was aware of it
I was certainly surprised to find you there
I was driven over by my employer
I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing
I was half-dragged up to the altar
I was mad--insane
I was not and am not sure which
I was only Crown Prince then
I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist
I was shaken but not hurt by the fall
I was so terrified that I do not know what I did
I was staggered
I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
I was sure that I might rely on you
I was very angry
I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
I will
I will do it
I will do nothing of the kind
I will do so
I will fly
I will get her to show me
I will go when I have said my say
I will make no allowance
I will not look
I will not stand it any longer
I will soon make it clear to you
I will tell you
I will tell you it just as it happened
I will tell you the true solution of the matter
I will try
I wired to Bristol for it last night
I wish to have a quiet word with you
I wish to the Lord
I wish you
I wish you were all at the devil together
I won
I would give my fortune to have them back
I would go
I would have endured imprisonment
I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl
I would pay ten
I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until

In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place
In the bathroom

In the cells
In the dress is a pocket

In this sinister way I came into my inheritance
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side

It
It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
It appears that his arrest did not take place at once
It came by the last post
It came here
It certainly sounds feasible
It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived
It goes to the housekeeper
It had cleared in the morning
It has been a case of considerable interest
It has been in some points a singular case
It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important
It is
It is K
It is The Morning Chronicle of April 
It is a curious thing
It is a little cold for the time of the year
It is a little fancy of my wife
It is a little off the beaten track
It is a most mysterious business
It is a murder
It is a nice household
It is a noiseless lock
It is a petty feeling
It is a question of cubic capacity
It is a question of hydraulics
It is a swamp adder
It is absolutely essential to me
It is also my custom
It is always a joy to meet an American
It is always awkward doing business with an alias
It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible
It is an ordinary plumber
It is both
It is clear that Mrs
It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions
It is due at Winchester at 
It is easy for me to be so
It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one
It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
It is fear
It is for me to ask you that
It is fortunate
It is half-past ten now
It is high
It is his hat
It is locked up
It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her
It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock
It is no ordinary one
It is no time for me to hide anything
It is no wonder that it did not wake you
It is not an English paper at all
It is not cold which makes me shiver
It is not worth your while to wait
It is not yet nine
It is nothing very formidable
It is obvious
It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground
It is our French gold
It is our task to find that out
It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been
It is possible
It is quite a pretty little problem
It is quite a three pipe problem
It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter
It is really two days since you had the letter
It is really very good of you to come
It is said that Mr
It is simplicity itself
It is so
It is so long a chain
It is so very kind of you both
It is solved
It is straight enough
It is the purest accident
It is to him that this trophy belongs
It is to keep people out who have no business there
It is true
It is true that I have been generally successful
It is unfortunately more than possible
It is very clear
It is very essential
It is very good of Lord St
It is very kind of you
It is very well to cringe and crawl now
It is wonderful
It is your only chance
It looks like it
It looks newer than the other things
It makes a considerable difference to me
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
It may be so
It may give him a sleepless night
It may not come to that
It may seem to point very straight to one thing
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think
It means that it is all over
It might have been difficult
It missed him
It must be recovered
It must stop here
It saved me from ennui
It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man
It seems that it was
It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter
It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated
It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
It surprised me
It was
It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it
It was a bitter night
It was a cold morning of the early spring
It was a confession
It was a few weeks before my own marriage
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street
It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park
It was a singular document
It was a singular sight which met our eyes
It was a slight
It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross
It was after five o
It was all-important
It was an hour
It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength
It was clamped to the floor
It was close upon four before the door opened
It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening
It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes
It was early in April in the year 
It was from the reigning family of Holland
It was in January
It was in the early 
It was in the latter days of September
It was in the summer of 
It was in vain to argue with him
It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in
It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned
It was lost
It was most suggestive
It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business
It was nearly four o
It was nearly one o
It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband
It was not the wife
It was not very long before my friend
It was obvious to me that my companion
It was only a joke at first
It was only yesterday that the chance came
It was pitch dark inside the house
It was too far for me to go
It was useless
It was very nice and complimentary of you
It was very sweet of you to come
It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
It would be injustice to hesitate
It would cease to be a danger if we could define it
It--it
Its disappearance

My dear young lady
My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller
My eye caught the name of Openshaw
My face lengthened at this
My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown
My friend smiled
My friend was an enthusiastic musician
My geese
My heart had turned to lead
My last client of the sort was a king
My messenger reached you
My name
My name is Helen Stoner
My name is John Robinson
My name is Sherlock Holmes
My opinion is in no way altered

None
None at all
None of those which come to me are
None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur
Nor from below
Nor running a chance of arrest
Not I
Not a bit
Not a bite
Not a word
Not at all
Not him
Not in a good cause
Not in the least
Not invisible but unnoticed
Not only that
Not particularly
Not so many as you might think
Not social
Not the Countess of Morcar
Not yet
Nothing
Nothing could have been better
Nothing to complain of

On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes
On the contrary
On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his
On your arm
One
One child--one dear little romper just six years old
One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne
One day--it was in March
One horse
One moment
One more question
One morning
One night--it was in June
One night--it was on the twentieth of March
One of his hands
One of the highest in England
One of the most precious public possessions of the empire
One other question
One tallow stain
Only as much as we can deduce
Only once
Only one little item in another of the morning papers
Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
Only that
Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man
Or rather
Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us
Or to sit here
Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy
Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase
Our quest is practically finished
Our visitor collapsed into a chair
Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid
Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking
Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand
Owe
P
Papier
Peculiar--that is the very word
Pending the alterations
Perfectly so
Perhaps
Perhaps I have
Perhaps we had better proceed to business
Perhaps we may make them less so
Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter
Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes
Photography is one of my hobbies
Pink 
Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow
Pon my word
Pondicherry postmark
Pooh
Pray
Pray be precise as to details
Pray compose yourself
Pray continue
Pray continue your narrative
Pray continue your very interesting statement
Pray do
Pray do so
Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement
Pray let us have it
Pray make no apology to me
Pray sit down on the sofa
Pray take a seat
Pray take the basket-chair
Pray take this chair by the fire
Pray tell us what has happened to you
Precisely
Precisely so
Proceed
Pshaw
Put the papers on the sundial
Quite an interesting study
Quite so
Quite sure
Read it aloud
Really
Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
Remember
Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
Ryder quivered with emotion
Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion

See that you keep yourself out of my grip
Seeing that my client was anxious to leave
Seven
She brought
She came in just now by the back door
She died just two years ago
She is of a quiet nature
She showed me
She told me to ask you
She walked into the breakfast-room
She was angry
She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony
She was never happy at home
She will not be able to
She will not sell
Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn
Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it
Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled
Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair
Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion
Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply
Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar
Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing
Sherlock Holmes laughed
Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily
Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined
Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder
Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle
Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question
Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised
Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table
Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau
Sherlock Holmes was
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon
Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this
Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture
Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem
Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place
Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding
Sir
Six out and six back
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room
Small
Smart fellow
So
So I am
So I have heard
So I heard
So I see
So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action
So it appears
So it is
So much for Mr
So much for the Lascar manager
So much for the servants
So much so
So they have
Sold out of geese
Sold to Mr
Some cold beef and a glass of beer
Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading
Some preposterous practical joke
Some ten or twelve
Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together
Some years ago--to be definite
Someone has loosed the dog
Something like fear sprang up in the young lady
Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium
Starving
Still
Stoke Moran
Stolen
Stop it
Subtle enough and horrible enough
Such are the true facts of the death of Dr
Such as they are
Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
Suddenly
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator
Surely
Surely it would be better to take no notice
Surely it would not be difficult to find out
Surely this is not your husband

Thank God
Thank God for that
Thank you
Thank you for this information
That
That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
That Miss Flora Millar
That also I could fathom
That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad
That hurts my pride
That is Mrs
That is a detail which I shall speedily supply
That is a possible solution--in fact
That is also quite modern
That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
That is better
That is easily got
That is enough
That is excellent
That is it on the dressing-table
That is not always so easy
That is not quite so common
That is our signal
That is possible
That is quite correct
That is the baboon
That is the letter which I have just received
That is the reward
That is unusual in a young girl
That is very awkward
That is very fortunate
That is well
That note only reached her yesterday
That sounds a little paradoxical
That was it
That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry
That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room
That white one with the barred tail
That will await him when he enters port
That will do
That will do very nicely
That would be unnecessary
That would suit me very well
That you are never beaten
That you may get away

The Lone Star had arrived here last week
The Lord St
The Man with the Twisted Lip

The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you
The band
The banker
The banker recoiled in horror
The banker wrung his hands
The best possible
The building was of grey
The case has been an interesting one
The case is as plain as a pikestaff
The cases which come to light in the papers are
The ceremony
The circumstances are of great delicacy
The decline of his fortunes
The doctor
The doctors examined her for it
The door of Briony Lodge was open
The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open
The end may have been so
The facts are briefly these
The family of Lord Robert St
The family was at one time among the richest in England
The fat man cast his eyes round
The fire looks very seasonable in this weather
The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within
The firm does so when the security is good
The first thing that put us out was that advertisement
The first was from Pondicherry
The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
The further points
The game
The gas was half up
The gentleman I describe
The glass still keeps very high
The goose
The grass was growing under it
The ideal reasoner
The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left
The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech
The knees of his trousers
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist
The lady could not move her bed
The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
The landlord of the Alpha
The law cannot
The leader of the gang
The least sound would be fatal to our plans
The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places
The letter arrived on March 
The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened
The man burst into a hearty laugh
The man hesitated for an instant
The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money
The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest
The man sat huddled up in his chair
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure
The man who entered was a sturdy
The man who entered was young
The man who wrote it was presumably well to do
The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us
The matter is too serious for any hesitation
The matter was perfectly simple
The murder was done with it
The name
The name is familiar to me
The name of the maker
The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London
The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin
The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana
The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire
The note was undated
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat
The old man sank his face in his hands
The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller
The other is a good three pound heavier
The paper was made in Bohemia
The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship
The police have watched this Lascar
The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
The postmark is London--eastern division
The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny
The propriety of my leaving it
The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other
The question was hardly out of my mouth
The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been
The rest you will leave in our hands
The right side
The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back
The salesman chuckled grimly
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one
The solemn Mr
The stable lane
The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
The station-master laughed heartily
The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting
The summons was a brief and urgent one
The sundial in the garden
The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in
The third on the right is his
The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder
The vanishing of the lady
The warning was no idle one
The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room
The work appears to be light and the pay munificent
The year 
The young lady came to London
The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope
Their reasons for their conduct
Then
Then I
Then I am your man
Then I can wait in the next room
Then I do not see the point
Then I fail to follow your Majesty
Then I have just time
Then I must begin
Then I shall call upon you in a day
Then I shall certainly come
Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
Then I shall go in it
Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out
Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company
Then I will
Then comes our expedition of to-day
Then dress
Then he might have called to you
Then how many are there
Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it
Then it was not Arthur who took them
Then let me do so
Then let us do so
Then my servant will call a cab
Then perhaps
Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it
Then pray send him home in it
Then put on your hat and come
Then that explains what the girl said
Then that will simplify matters
Then the matter stands thus
Then the page we have seen--
Then they carried me in
Then we can hardly get there before midnight
Then we had a talk as to what we should do
Then we have stopped all the holes
Then we shall both come
Then what are they
Then what has happened to him
Then you don
Then you may be so with me
Then you may entirely rely on me
Then you won
Theories are all very well
There
There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn
There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action
There are none
There are none missing
There are one or two very singular points about this room
There are several quiet little villages up there
There are thirty-nine enormous beryls
There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
There are three men waiting for him at the door
There are three missing
There can be no question as to their nature
There has been some villainy here
There is a drive
There is a friend of mine here
There is a little nut for you to crack
There is a train at half-past nine
There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway
There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship
There is but one thing to do
There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub
There is ever a flaw
There is no mystery
There is no possible getting out of it
There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact
There is one other thing you owe
There is one thing
There is serious news this morning
There is some building going on there
There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work
There is the gravel-drive
There is the writing
There is water in your eyes
There is your hat
There isn
There was a double line of tracks of a booted man
There was a little passage in front of me
There was a long silence
There was a movement and an exclamation from my right
There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week
There was little difficulty in entering the grounds
There was no rain
There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table
There was the case
There were none
There were several people on the pavement at the time
There will call upon you to-night
There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market
There you are
These are very deep waters
These are young McCarthy
They always fill me with a certain horror
They are all seaports
They are coiners on a large scale
They are never sold upon hats
They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them
They are typewritten
They considered that it might be caused by Arthur
They have
They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
They have but one retreat
They have laid the supper
They may do what they like
They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently
They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure
They must be cunning devils
They must have done so
They often vanish before the ceremony
They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes
They used to send father tickets when he was alive
They will be here in a moment
They would have had the lady
Think of my father
Third right
This
This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
This account of you we have from all quarters received
This aroused my curiosity
This concluded the examination of the witness
This discovery
This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
This gentleman
This gentleman was not one of your wife
This has been done
This hat has not been brushed for weeks
This hat is three years old
This is Mr
This is a map of the Colony of Victoria
This is a very deep business
This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
This is all quite beside the question
This is indeed a mystery
This is indeed important
This is my friend
This is my friend and colleague
This is my secretary and manager
This is the Dundas separation case
This is the envelope
This is the girl
This is wanting in the police report
This is where we shall find them
This matter
This may interest you
This photograph
This time
This was quite too good to lose
This went on day after day
Threatens to send them the photograph
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses
Through the skylight
Tired-looking or fresh
To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
To Eyford
To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman
To an English lawyer named Norton
To an end
To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned
To do nothing whatever
To eat it
To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
To ruin me
To smoke
To tell the truth
To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
To the man who loves art for its own sake
To the police

Watson
We
We are close there now
We are in a civilised land here
We are now
We are on the outskirts of Lee
We both put our eyes to the grating
We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative
We both thought the best resource was flight
We could see the other side of the road and the Park
We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
We got off
We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door
We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning
We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him
We have at least an hour before us
We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing
We have got to the deductions and the inferences
We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
We have had the pleasure of making the doctor
We have judged it best that you should come late
We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work
We have retained these things for some days
We have touched on three English counties in our short drive
We have tried and failed
We heard the door open
We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible
We must be circumspect
We must have a cab
We must sit without light
We never thought that she would have been so carried away
We passed across Holborn
We passed up the stair
We sat in silence for some minutes
We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o
We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
We shall see
We shall soon set matters right
We shall spend the night in your room
We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate
We went upstairs together
We were as good as our word
We were both in the photograph
We were seated at breakfast one morning
Wedlock suits you
Well
Well then
Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
Were they all fastened this morning
Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
What
What I cannot understand
What I expected to see
What a time it seemed
What a woman--oh
What are they
What are you doing there
What are you going to do
What becomes
What can I do for you
What can be the matter
What can he hope to find there
What can it mean
What can you not understand
What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life
What could she mean by that note
What did you go into the pool for
What do you call purely nominal
What do you imagine that it means
What do you make of that
What do you mean
What do you read
What do you say
What do you think
What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of
What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches
What has she been saying to you
What have I to do with sundials and papers
What have you done
What have you to say now
What is he like
What is it
What is the meaning of it all
What is the name of this obliging youth
What is the young man
What of the rat
What of this 
What office
What on earth can be the matter with him
What on earth does this mean
What on earth has that to do with it
What papers
What shall I do
What steps will you take
What then
What will the Duke say
What will you do
What will you say
What will you take for the geese
What would be the hours
Whatever were you doing with that bird
Whatever your reasons may be
When Dr
When Horner had been arrested
When I arrived at the house
When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years 
When I got back I told my maid
When I hear you give your reasons
When I went down there I found him talking with his son
When Mrs
When did it break out
When did she vanish
When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me
When he was gone I unlocked my bureau
When my father took over the Horsham property
When the commissionaire had gone
When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner
When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
When you go out close the door
When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the

Where did you address your letters
Where does that bell communicate with

Which are
Which dealer
Which is it you want
Which key was used to open it
Which of you is Holmes
Which surely he restored to their owner
Which were very well justified
While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
Who are you
Who by
Who did you sell the geese to
Who ever heard of such a mixed affair
Who is on duty
Who knows
Who was he
Who was the criminal
Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
Whose house is it
Why
Why did you beat the pavement
Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
Why did you come to me
Why did you pick him
Why do you think that I lock this door
Why does fate play such tricks with poor
Why is he silent
Why serious
Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint
Why shouldn
Why that
Will you bet
Will you come with me
Will you go
With a dazed face the banker made out the required check
With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
With making away with Mr
With the result of driving it through the ventilator

Yesterday
Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound
You
You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me
You are all wrong
You are certainly joking
You are engaged
You are fatigued with your haste
You are fresh from a night journey
You are hungry
You are looking for a situation
You are mad
You are not very vulnerable from above
You are right
You are sure of it
You are sure that she has not sent it yet
You are the first who have ever heard my story
You are to watch me
You are very kind
You blackguard
You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct
You can easily imagine
You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you
You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives
You can pass through the door
You can see him very well
You can understand
You cannot say what it was
You could not possibly have come at a better time
You did
You did it very nicely
You did not overhear what they said
You didn
You don
You doubt its value
You dragged them from the Serpentine
You fill me with interest
You forget that I know nothing about it
You had my note
You have
You have a clue
You have a grand gift of silence
You have a maid who has a sweetheart
You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
You have an answer to everything
You have been cruelly used
You have been recommended to me
You have been very kind
You have but to name it
You have called me names enough
You have carte blanche
You have come to me to tell your story
You have compromised yourself seriously
You have destroyed it
You have done well indeed
You have done wisely
You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
You have erred
You have given me fresh life and hope
You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated
You have it
You have made your position very clear to me
You have neither of you any doubt as to your son
You have no chance at all
You have really got it
You have the photograph
You hear
You heard nothing yourself last night
You horrify me
You interest me extremely
You know me
You know my method
You look dissatisfied
You may address me as the Count Von Kramm
You may as well face the matter
You may imagine
You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins
You may place considerable confidence in Mr
You may rely upon my doing all that I can
You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me
You must act
You must confine yourself to your room
You must know
You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph
You must leave that to me
You must make allowance for this poor girl
You must not fear
You must speak to her in the morning
You really are very fine indeed
You reasoned it out beautifully
You saw the ventilator
You see
You see it
You see it is really confined to Londoners
You seem to expect company
You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl
You shall learn nothing from me
You shall leave it in the hands of the police
You shall not have a farthing from me
You shut up the windows and doors the night before
You speak of danger
You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks
You think so
You think that he is dead
You understand
You villain
You want to go home
You were not yourself at fault at all
You were travelling in the States
You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
You will
You will be the ruin of us
You will excuse me
You will excuse me for not waiting for you
You will excuse my beginning without you
You will excuse my calling so late
You will excuse my troubling you
You will excuse this mask
You will find it rather disconnected
You will leave that question in my hands
You will not go there first
You will observe
You will remember that I remarked the other day
You will see me when all is ready
You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow
You work your own method
You would have done better to have trusted you wife
You would not think 
Your French gold
Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly
Your Majesty must pay
Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese
Your boy
Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
Your conversation is most entertaining
Your duty would be
Your experience has been a most entertaining one
Your father
Your hands
Your morning letters
Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one

Your presence might be invaluable

Your red-headed idea was very new and effective

Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him
a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
a man with so large a brain must have something in it

and I
and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved
and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result
and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg
and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up
and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes
and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them
and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League
and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you
and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
and the humbler are usually the more interesting
and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable
and then I will feel sure of you
and we fattened it expressly for you

but
but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now
but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me
but I have had a very serious accident during the night
but I have had a very strange experience
but I must have this money
but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me
but if it is all the same to you
but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now
but if you want to get to the house
but it
but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
but now I know where the letters are without looking
but since
but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest
but the papers must be those that are destroyed
but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction
but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning
but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications
